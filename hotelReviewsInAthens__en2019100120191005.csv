0,"This is a fine, modern, luxury hotel in a location that offers panoramic views and easy access to major attractions in Athens. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the housekeeping services are absolutely outstanding (we never had to ask for towels!), the Wi-Fi is fast, and the food and service in the restaurants is excellent (we had at least breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the property).Now for the caveats. First, the website makes it appear as though the Acropolis is closer than it actually is, so the view isn't quite as stunning as you might think. Second, the rooftop pool area is rather small, and therefore inadequate for a hotel of this size. Good luck finding a spot--I wound up reading my book seated at a hightop table (not comfortable). Third, everything is incredibly expensive. We needed to grab a quick lunch at the ""casual"" restaurant off the lobby due to our schedule, and it cost about $100 for a burger, a grilled chicken sandwich, and a salad. That's among the more expensive lunches we've ever had. I'm sure we'd pay the same at the Ritz Carlton in New York, but yikes! Similarly, think twice before grabbing a bottled water from the mini-bar in your room. Also, our visit was during a summer heatwave in Athens, and I was surprised that the hotel experienced regular blackouts during our stay. This is not entirely in the hotel's control of course, though I would have expected a facility of this size and quality to have backup generators that would supply uninterrupted power. At one point we lost power for so long that the water stopped working in our room, and since the elevators were not operational we wound up having to walk down eight flights of stairs to get on with our activities. I also found that our rooms was not particularly quiet; despite being on the eighth floor I could hear sirens and cars horns from the streets below well into the night.All that being said, this is a quality hotel, and I would certainly consider staying here again when I return to Athens. Some of the caveats above are simply par for the course in a metropolitan hotel; I mention them purely in the interest of full disclosure.","July 12, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

1,Divani is a hotel close to the airport highway which means that in 25 minutes you can reach the airport. As you enter a stylish lobby awaits you and a more that cheerful staff is ready to welcome you.the rooms are ok but the lobby bar and the pool bar are amazing.

3,"The hotel is a typical large city hotel, lots of room with a big turnover of guests, it is clean and functional, rooms are standard not luxourious and have no special touch to make it a 5 star hotel, the location is slightly out of the centre but everywhere is realitivly easy to get to breakfast is not included so just go behind the hotel to a lovely local area of bars and restaurants and pay third of the price, nothing really wrong with the hotel just dont be fooled that it really is a good standard for a three star review ","July 6, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

5,"Stayed here one night when in town on business. It's a nice, full service hotel with all you'd expect of a five-star joint. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were large, clean and comfortable. The air conditioning was nice and cold! Facilities were good, and I had most of what I needed in the room. The bathroom was also large and clean. I noticed that my toilet wasn't fixed to the floor properly, which was a bit of a worry, but otherwise all was fine. Breakfast was okay too.The only issue I had with the hotel itself was that the lifts were quite slow and small, and the hotel location is a bit outside the main area of town. It's a good 20--30 min walk to town, including a walk along a busy highway. It is a quick taxi ride back though, about 10 EUR, so not too bad. This is compensated by a great rooftop bar, where you'll get views of the Acropolis, so that's pretty nice!Not a bad spot!","June 30, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

6,"When we were looking for a place for wedding party in last December we had had only one thing on our minds: to offer unforgettable quality moments to our guests -family and friends- who would come and celebrate with us our unique moment. We couldn't afford to give a fortune but we didn't want to choose a cheap place just to minimize the cost and maximize our profit from collected gifts.With this in mind we saw many hotels. We had looked premises near the city because we cared about the guest's convenience and safety: it's stupid to expect from people to have fun and drink on the one hand and to drive back safely long distances on the other hand.Divani Caravel's qualified person -Giota- was very friendly and helpful from the first time. We called her and arranged a meeting at the venue, on the last floor. You should visit this place, it has a unique view of all the town,including Acropolis and Hymettus.We had discussed with Giota about our needs, about the place, music, number of guest, menu etc. We finally were excited. We agreed and at the They were very understandable all the time. In the second meeting we clarified all the details abut the event.On the day of the wedding party everything was perfect. They showed professionalism and great experience. Decoration was as agreed, everything clean, personnel was friendly and polite during the night.Maitre d'hotel -great man and professional- came to our room (free offer from Hotel to wedding couple) and introduce us to the hall, and helped us cutting the wedding cake. After that, the party began!Positive:- Location. No guest will get tired or in danger with long distances.- unbelievable in quality and variety of the food and sweets: our guests loved it and hotel had left it available all the time of the party! It's a five star restaurant offering unforgettable taste combinations. Try it. Moreover their wine is really good!- Shocking view of Athens and Acropolis lighted.- Polite and professional personnel, even when they were tired after hours of service.- Free suite for the night after the wedding as a gift form the hotel- Everything as agreed. (This is the most important from my point of view. They did everything as they had promised, which is quite rare in wedding party's industry)Negative:- I would prefer a bit larger area and dance floor. But nothing important. In conclusion: If you're looking for a place for quality and unforgettable wedding party, Divani Caravel is your place. It will may cost you more than other places but i guarantee that the difference is really HUGE!This review is a bit late (wedding was late in December) but 100% honest and fair for the hotel. Every time me, my wife or a friend of us are thinking the night of wedding party we bring back nice thoughts and great feelings. Many of them exist because of the hotel's unique services. And this is priceless....","June 30, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

7,"Interestingly enough that manager responses to average and negative reviews universally start with “we never had such a complain before...”It’s rather concerning.Hotel is old and outdated (70-th-80th), hallways are smelly (likely because they mixing smoking and non-smoking rooms on the same floor), staff seems very busy and distant. Room was very clean, equipped with everything you might need.Nice bedding. Good view of the city.We where given a smoking room (honest mistake frankly) but front clerk didn’t even apologized, she made a “surprise” impression, and immediately tried to remind my wife that she made a reservation for one person instead of two (there is no difference in price).Weird.Overall, make a 3-star impression.I wouldn’t stay in this place again.","June 28, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

9,"Came for a congress last weekend, arrived very late, was upgraded to a fabulous suite! Good start! Breakfast was great, room spacious and clean, hotel's pool on the roof- nice and cool.....however....at the dsy of departure I had to argue with front dedk clerck as my congress reserved the room for 2 (and my husband cancelled his arrival)- they kept asking again (should he have come I would have to oat extra for his stay) and doubting my answers, despite the fact they could easily look into my arrival details (I checked in at 2am, not the busiest hour), meals (eaten alone)and any other information regarding the room and its use. This attitude is far from welcoming and certainly affected my overall impression. Sorry about that.

10,"Caravel is one of the three Divani hotels in Athens and the one I enjoy the most as it offers modern rooms in a quite edge of Athens centre for a reasonable price for its upscale category.The rooms are large and well equipped, the service very very freindly and efficient, conference facilities and cafe and dining options are also satisfactory.The central Athens airport is just 30 mins by taxi, the nearest metro station (""Evangelismos"") is 10 mins walk away though.There planty of nice cafes, tavernas and even gourmet restaurant very close by.I would also recommend a visit to the Byzantine museum of Athens and Benaki museum (see separate reviews) - that are just 8-10 mins walk from this hotel.","June 21, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

The thing that really threw me off was the fact that it was extremely busy and I noticed that the hotel didn’t have enough staff to properly treat the customers . We waited 15 minutes for a coffee at the breakfast area which was full and there were only 3 waiters working , at least for the time we were there ! The staff was kind and was trying to assist us even if they were running like crazy .","June 3, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

19,"Actually our findings were better than average, however there wasn’t a section for ‘good’. The hotel itself is very nice and opulent in many ways. The room is clean, bright and well appointed. The breakfast is well provided for, fresh and the service attentive. The pool is lovely and actually a nice escape from the city below with outstanding views.So overall, quite good- only negatives for us would be the location, really not central enough from the quality restaurants and action. You need a taxi each time you want to go out. The drinks by the pool are overly expensive - 28 e for two drinks, however I guess that view must come at a cost. The music was repetitive and boring if you were there too long. Being such a busy hotel, providing for conferences, it was disappointing to see people’s used food dishes etc sit outside in the corridors for over 24 hours. Lastly I was surprised that I couldn’t access an iron for my clothes, I would have thought this was pretty standard at this level of hotel. So overall, quite nice, just some minor areas that could be improved. ","June 2, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

20,"We arrived very tired at 10 am after flying all night from Toronto on Transat and were happy to find out that our room was ready and we could freshen up before we ventured out. That made all the difference in our day as tired travelers. The staff was very polite and welcoming. Our room was a standard room, very clean and comfortable. Although we could have taken the shuttle or a bus to the tourist areas we used cabs to save time. It was only a 5 euro cab ride to Syntagma Square which we thought was very reasonable.After a tiring day (up for 30 hours!) we had dinner at the rooftop bar to enjoy the view of the Acropolis. The food was very good, reasonably priced for a hotel and the service was prompt and friendly. Breakfast which was included was the very best out of all of our two week stay in Greece-Mykonos and Santorini.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Athens.","May 31, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

21,"We stayed at a great little boutique hotel, Estia Boutique, for three days and then at Divani Caravel, a so-called ""world class, five-star"" hotel for two days. While we sat in the lobby of Divani Caravel for four hours waiting for our room to be assigned (a whole other terrible experience in itself) we watched the two women at the front reception desk (older blonde and older redhead) abuse customer after customer, in two cases actually shouting at the people. It was clear that they felt that they needed to ""put customers in their place"" right from the start. If you get through them successfully, what you will find is a massive hotel which is based on huge numbers of customers, not customer service. If you like huge, anonymous, ""business hotels"", Divani Caravel is probably as good as the others, other than the receptionists (we have never experienced anything like them anywhere we have ever been). But we know where we would go--no competition--we would pick Estia Boutique one hundred times out of one hundred.","May 30, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

We were upgraded to a suite, which has made my Mum's recuperation so much easier, the room is well equipped with a large balcony, Illy coffee machine, good wardrobe space, comfortable chairs and beds, sofa, dining table. We could not have asked for more. The staff were very understanding of our situation. We've had room service which was delicious, and served to make you feel special. There are good restaurants nearby, and a supermarket within walking distance.

25,"This is about my third and last stay at this place. The typical hotel of a dated era, where the rooms don’t match the nice lobby. There are a couple of things that really bother me. If not for those it might be worthy another point for a middle of the road, one night stand. The good..Nice rooftop pool and view. Convenient area with plenty of eateries and shopping nearby. The not so goodMold in the air conditioners. You can smell it, see it and feel it. (See attached pictures below) Management doesn’t seem to think it’s important to fix this. If you care about your health, skip reading any further and check out another hotel option. Not the best at housekeeping; re-used pillow covers and the occasional Unchanged sheets. Yes I have a black light And goggles I carry with me. With that also a good sniffer. There is always a difference in the smell and feel of washed, bleached sheets and used ones. Dirty sheets don’t feel as stiff and smell like B.O. Dirty bottom of mini fridge. It’s the details that reveal just how well kept a room is, and how thorough rooms are serviced. Here the main objective seems to be turning the room over to the next guest. Paneling and oak/veneer everywhere. No carpet, which is a plus but defeats the purpose of hygiene when you have to inhale moldy air particles. Non secure WiFi. Low pressure showers. Very slippery tile (when wet) I can overlook everything except for cleanliness and moldy air conditioners.... and no, it’s not just a single event. I’ve experienced this, during every stay. There is a restaurant in the lobby area, which I decided not to visit. If there are hygiene issues in one area, You’ve lost my trust to ingest anything here.

35,"Central location, clean, fabulous breakfast buffet bar, friendly staff. The best part of our stay, to me, was that the rooms were QUIET; couldn't hear noise from other rooms or even the hallway. The bedroom room was a really nice size, elegant and comfortable. The bathroom was large and sophisticated. The spa was really nice (I had a facial and body scrub/massage) and clean, and the pool was small but big enough for March - don't think it would be for the warmer months. We got a fabulous deal on the room and I wouldn't have been happier!!","March 19, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

36,"Hotel is located almost in centre of Athens, even you can walk to Sintagma square, or you take a taxi, will cost 4-5 eur.Hotel staff friendly, rooms are comfortable, clean, sound proof. Only thing what was little dissapointing in this kind of hotel is that I booked Exectutive room, but the room was average in matter od sq meters, probably like basic/standard room. Maybe the hotel staff should make better photos of each kind of room, so the guest would see excatly how the room look like.Breakfast was good, lot of food, all sorts.","March 16, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

37,"To be fair, I have stayed at Divani Caravel several times and it used to be one of my favourite options in the past, both for business as well as for leisure. We have even had one of our conferences there some time ago. Overall it has been my first option in the area over the past 5 years.The reception staff is always very attentive and polite. In many cases they would upgrade my room to a nicer one at the same price. This has always been appreciated. Their breakfast is very good and I appreciate the fact that their gym facilities are now free of charge and quite good, compared to the past when one had to pay an extra fee for using them. The room service is excellent and always timely.Again: to be fair I have to say that my last stay to Divani Caravel was canceled due to family illness, so this review is not about ""my stay"", but my overall experience + my experience while dealing with this cancelation. While the booking I have made was non-refundable, and I totally understand the risks and what it means as I have traveling quite extensively and at least once per month over the past 10 years due to my job, the Divani Caravel reservations office was completely rigid and strict with their policy. It is very understandable that a very last-minute cancelation may damage the hotel, but a 1-week notice may not be that disastrous! Especially for a 5-star hotel like Divani Caravel in the center of Athens!Hence, the reservation staff should be completely ashamed of the way they handle these cases! To be fair to other hotels both in Athens but elsewhere that handle such cases in a much more professional and understanding manner, I cannot give this hotel more than a single star rating this time.But to recap: this is an excellent hotel to stay! But please pray that nothing will happen to you even a week in advance while having taken a non-refundable deal. Then be prepared to pay for it! Otherwise, I would recommend considering alternative hotels in the neighbourhood that are more understanding of such situations! Which is what I am planning to do for now on as well as all the employees in my organisation.","March 9, 2019","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

I can say with conviction it is the best hotel restaurant i have eaten in in quite some time. I was looked after by George Apostolides, Maitre D, and his attentive staff. Chef Savvas Lihanidis served me up a fabulous meal. I enjoyed a basket of freshly baked greek bread served with butter flaked with gold.... yes this told me a superb dining experience was in store. I enjoyed a fabulous crab with chilli and truffle oil starter, the flavours were simply sublime, complimenting each other. I enjoyed a deliciously medium cooked signature house burger for my mains with an accompaniment of freshly made salted crisps as we call them here in ireland. George a knowlegeable Maitre D recommended a lovely wine to accompany the meal. all in all, if you are in Athens and have cause to stay in this fabulous hotel, I can recommend enjoying a meal and service in the Ju Ju bar and restaurant.

43,"The Divani Caravel is a fine hotel for those looking to explore the city a bit.Location: It's located in a nicer, upscale part of town, but it's not really walking distance to the historic parts. While you can see the Acropolis from the rooftop pool, it's still about an hour walk to the Acropolis from the hotel, or around 20 minutes by taxi. There are several good restaurants nearby, but you will want to head west a bit toward the city center to explore better options.Rooms: The rooms are fine, about what I expect from an international Marriott-type hotel. Nothing exceptional, but nothing horrific to write about here, either.Pool: It's not very large, and on nice days expect it to get crowded up there. Seats can be at a premium. There's also a rooftop bar, but like all food and drink options in a hotel, it's quite overpriced for what you get.Food: The breakfast option is plentiful and has options for most dietary types. Much like the rooms, it was comparable to what you'd find in an international Marriott. I did not eat at the restaurant for dinner as there are several fine options within walking distance of the hotel.","November 16, 2018","0    Divani Caravel Hotel

They were all helpful, courteous and knowledgeable. They all spoke excellent English-Breakfast was included in my package. Breakfast wasn't amazing but it was good enough. There was not that much variety but what was there, was good.-The hotel is located in between Larissa and Victoria stations which is very convenient. It's about a 30 minute walk to Acropolis from the hotel if you don't want to take public transportThe negatives:-The room was functional and good. The bathroom and shower were excellent. I only found the bed a bit too hard and low-Other reviewers already mentioned the area the hotel is in. There are definitely some shady characters around the area, especially at night.

Breakfast had a good selection and worth the extra cost.Very easy to get into central Athens. We preferred to turn left out of the hotel to get to the metro (Larissa station - red line 4 stops to Syntagma square/ 5 stops to Akropolis) as it was much less busy and more pleasant - although the Victoria stop is slightly closer (turn right) it was jam packed and definitely felt more focussed on watching belongings etc. Felt safe walking to and from the metro and surrounding area. Good bakery on same street (turn left and opposite) with lots of tempting cakes to choose from.

We were given a spacious room with a comfortable bed, fridge, safe & coffee table. The bathroom was large & beautifully tiled & there was a whirlpool bath which was a delight after a day in the sun exploring the fabulous but dusty archeological sites. The room had a generous sized balcony furnished with 2 chairs & a table & overlooking a residential street. Ok, the location is not the best part of Athens, being a 10 minute walk from Victoria Metro station. It has a large immigrant population & is obviously a poor area but never once did we feel unsafe or threatened, unlike on the Metro when we were actually pickpocketed. (We would recommend using Larrissa Metro station where possible as opposed to Victoria when staying at the Centrotel as it was quieter & therefore less of a magnet for thieves.) Breakfast was good with omelettes & bacon, fresh orange juice, hams & cheeses, yoghurt, honey, fresh bread etc. We were disappointed not to have tea making facilities in our room but within 10 minutes of asking at reception a kettle was brought up free of charge. It really was excellent service. The room was immaculately clean as was every area of the hotel. I would definitely recommend this very reasonably priced 2☆ hotel to anyone visiting Athens.

The area around is not the coolest or more elegant and is quite crowded at night, but we felt safe all the time and honestly we liked the location: a bit outside the turistic area, but 1-2 minutes walking from the Victoria metro station (2 stops and you are in the heart of Athens); taxis are also availble if you prefer. We choose the option without breakfast so we cannot give our opinion on that. The price was more than onest for the service we received. We surely recommend to stay here while in Athens!","July 24, 2018","1    Centrotel Hotel

74,"Yes, location is not the greatest and initially can intimidate a guest. Its a run down neighborhood inhabited with low income peaceful immigrants. But its quite safe even at night and a short walk from from Victoria Metro station. Once you get familiar with your surrounding, you will quite comfortable. Here you will find more non-greek restaurants to choose from with competitive prices. Probably the best value in Athens. Staff is very helpful and rooms are well appointed but nothing fancy.

75,"My wife and I had a great stay at Centrotel. It's modern, clean and well maintained. We had a double bed and balcony room on the 4th floor. Decent size and plenty of storage, lovely bathroom too with whirlpool bath tub - which you could only use between certain hours which was strange but up till 10pm. The shower was a hose one connected to the bath taps which was okay but the hook for it was too low down unless you're short, and with full pressure from the tap it would spray in a different direction to how you wanted it, but this was a minor gripe. It had two sliding doors out to the balcony to block out noise and light which it did very well, actually the room was pitch black with both closed even at the brightest part of the day! The bed was oddly low to the ground and mattress quite firm.Free Wifi with good connection.Aircon.Underground Car park but I wouldn't advise driving in central Athens and the roads around the hotel are narrow and many parked cars both sides.Despite the relatively run down area the location is good, metro stops 5-10min walk left (Larissa Station) or right (Victoria) out of the front door, a 5 day long metro ticket can be bought for 5 Euro per person and will get you to most places quickly - 10-15mins to the Acropoli / Syntagma central stops (trains run every 5mins too!) and conveniently. The same ticket can be used on all other public transport too, trams and buses, we used the tram to ride along the coast to visit the beaches and Glyfada. We actually never needed to use a taxi. We walked back at all sorts of times, including close to midnight and didn't feel unsafe, although there are a few people lingering around at all hours and some paths dimly lit which might bother some people. Our bus excursions didn't pickup from this hotel - probably due to the narrow street, however they did pickup outside Hotel Oscar a 5min walk away on a much wider road.Staff were polite, friendly and accommodating - when we asked for extra pillow withing minutes someone knocked on the door with them. We didn't eat the €7.5 pp breakfast and opted for eating local Koulouri (Greek Sesame Bread rings) or croissants that were very cheap at around €1-€2 each.Would happily recommend and stay there again.","June 23, 2018","1    Centrotel Hotel

76,"I lived in Athens as a student but hadn’t been back the last ten years. This hotel was perfect for napping after a long-haul flight, and as a base for short trips in the capital city. 1. Service: 10/10. Friendly and efficient staff. All of them! Very rare! 10/102. Breakfast: 9/10. Authentic spinach pie! Lovely olives. Greek yoghurt and honey! Decent muesli! Good omelette. Tasty little sausages. Big thumbs up. 3. Price to quality is excellent. 10/10. Very reasonable prices. 4. Interior design: 9/10. For a mid-price place, it is very good looking. Walnut wood panels in lift/elevator; and pretty paintings going Into dining room. The bathrooms look great. 5. Bedroom is very comfortable. 8.5/10. Sleep quality very good. The window shutters seem top of the range and very effective for security and keeping the room dark. Cute balconies with nice urban views. Sound proofing is good. The shower does not attach well to the wall. 6. Location is debatable but I liked it. 7/10. Viktoria metro station is 8 minutes walk. on the same line as Piraeus port, making it easy to catch the ferry to the islands. If you want fashionable cafes and bakeries they are close to the metro station. Admittedly the streets nearer the hotel have become a hanging out place for middle eastern migrants. I never felt threatened at all. 6b. One benefit of the location is the excellent and cheap local Halal restaurants (Kabul, turn right out of hotel and you’ll see it on left hand side after 3 minutes walk. Fantastic chicken stew). And the area is great for people watching, compassion-building and a spot of photo-journalism.","June 16, 2018","1    Centrotel Hotel

77,"Athens & SantoriniOn my travel experience to Athens & Santorini, here are my simple point-wise Guide:Athens for 2.5 days:1. Land in Airport, take X95 Bus to Syntagma Square (The main hub in the city housing the Parliament) - Bus ticket per person is 6Euro. 2. We had taken Centrotel Hotel near Victoria Station- a decent one with well connectivity and near an Bangladeshi restaurant called Bijoy3. Take Athena Card for 5days & 9 Euro per person. This is convenient and cheap. With this you can travel in Athens, excluding Airport, by Metro, Tram, Bus. 4. See Acropolis, Museum, Syntagma Square Parade(on every Sunday) and other Historic sites. Don't forget to visit the Old Parliament and spend time there! It's very near to Syntagma. 5. Be a little cautious, there are petty pick pocketers. 6. We stayed for 2.5days and then went to Venice. Santorini for 1day:1. Oia is the Scenic place with Blue & White House- Hold many film shootings.2. There is lack of public transport to all places... Take a car for a day for 30 Euro (excluding petrol- which costs another 15 Euro). This is the cheapest and most convenient way to travel.3. You have to buy water - It is costly - Starting from 2 Euro.4. Generally 1 day is enough - you may take 2 days for leisure.","May 23, 2018","1    Centrotel Hotel

The bed was a bit on the hard side but the room was very quiet. We thought it was good value for Athens. We didn’t find the area at all intimidating ( as some people have commented) and never felt threatened or uneasy. It does have a visible immigrant population, they use the streets and public areas to socialise which is not unusual in city areas where people live predominantly in flats. But there were also plenty of Greek people around using the bars and shops. Athens centre and the metro were more of a problem because of the pickpockets.

The staff is very nice by the way! We also booked the breakfast on the last day of our stay which was great as well. They hat joghurt, fruits, bacon and eggs, cereals, sweet croissants.

85,"I got a clean, spacious double room. There are semi-controls for the central heating vents but easily got the temperature right by turning the heating off and opening the sliding balcony doors for a short period. These have blackout screens and curtains and kept out light and noise for a good night’s sleep. WiFi strength and speed were good enough for streaming. I did not have breakfast here. Short walk from Athens central train station (attached to Larissa Metro) and Victoria Square Metro. The room I got and the hotel lobby are easily 4-star standard. Staff were lovely whom I spoke to in English. The area can come across as a slum with a lively community in the day. When I arrived late at night, the street the Hotel is on was largely deserted apart from a few people who looked like they were heading home and there was also a friendly dog walker. You will not encounter any more graffiti here than most of Athens but there are more empty or derelict properties. I got some curious stares during the day as a male traveller but I wouldn’t say the area was unsafe as long as one is street smart. If you travel solo or as a timid couple and don’t think you can handle feeling a bit vulnerable walking back to your hotel then I suggest you look elsewhere.

92,"The area around Centrotel seems very residential. If you are expecting glamour in Greece, think again. Walking from the station to the hotel, you will definitely see stray cats, hard rubbish, graffiti and a lack of street lights. Do not be alarmed, this scenery is common around Athens. We never felt unsafe walking around as we stuck to walking the main streets and walked with a basic awareness of our surroundings. Centrotel is located about 20minutes walk from Central Athens and only 5 minutes to two different Metro lines (Victoria and Larissa Stations). Service was impeccable. All staff we came across spoke English and were extremely helpful. Check in was easy and smooth. We got to our room to find a clean and very spacey room. When we first tried to turn the air con on, it wouldn't work so I called reception to ask how to turn it on and she was polite in telling us that the Windows all need to be closed in order for it to work. Simply enough, it was fine after that. Being Mid August, it was heaven coming back to a cool room after a day of walking and melting in the 38+ degree heat! We booked a basic room with only a shower but this was definitely more than enough. We had plenty of space either side of the bed, plus a closet, desk, small TV and the bathroom had ample space and a large shower. I also loved the ceiling lights which were story of arranged like colour changing star lights (not sure how to describe!). It was very cool!A few other things to mention; the black out windows were also amazing for sleeping in. No light whatsoever would come into the room. The fridge in the room also came with two free bottles of water (Not supposed to drink tap water or use it for brushing your teeth). And I also bought a large 1 or 1.5L bottle of water from reception). Lots of mirrors around the room which was nice to get make up done or check outfits. Full bars of wifi in our room as well.Overly, we would happily stay again and recommend to others.

We were able to get from the airport to the hotel no problems via the metro at the cost of €10. You can also purchase a metro ticket for the city for 5 days at €9 each which was also perfect for us. Due to our early flight home we preferred to book a taxi back to the airport which the hotel was more than happy to arrange for us (taxi was €42 fixed price). They also provide breakfast for €7 euros if you are hungry in the morning.

I did not eat breakfast there because of other commitments. I accidentally booked a double room for my bestie and myself. The staff honored my request for a twin room and charged me the same rate. The double is perfect for a couple. The twin room was larger with a huge Jacuzzi tub. ","May 9, 2017","1    Centrotel Hotel

Other attractions such as the Plaka shopping district, the Temple of Zeus, and Herod's Arch are walking distance as well. In addition, the rooftop restaurant, while a bit overpriced, has a nice view of the Acropolis at night. The breakfast buffet is varied and very tasty. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The room, however, could use some updating. While the bathroom had obviously been renovated, the room itself was quite small and the decor and furniture need improvement.

115,"This is our second stay at the Herodion Hotel for a total of 7 nights. The staff have always been very helpful. Early in our trip planning we wanted to purchase tickets for the Odeon of Herodes Atticus theater, through email the staff were able to help us coordinate the purchase of tickets. (Highly recommend visitors look into attending an event. There are concerts, comedy, symphonies etc.)While we have only stayed in the center of Athens a few times, I do not imagine you could find a better location. The steps to the Acropolis and the Odeon Theater are a 5 minute stroll from the Herodion. Plaka, Monastiraki, and Syntagma Square are all very, very close. No need to rent a car while at the Herodion.The rooms are very clean and housekeeping checks to make sure the room has all you need in the afternoon. We booked a balcony room this trip. The balcony was beautiful but the view was not. Across the street was an apartment building that didn’t provide much of view. During our next stay we will book a different room view.Finally, the rooftop bar/lounge/restaurant. The view of the Acropolis is breathtaking. We have enjoyed dinner, cocktails and tapas on the rooftop. The pictures on the hotel website are the views you will enjoy. Also, the New Acropolis Museum, one short block away, is beautiful to see at night from the rooftop. Overall, our stays at the Herodion Hotel have been wonderful.

We loved our stay, could not of had a better location, easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go, especially the big ticket “ancient” attractions, and certainly no shortage of great food options. Very pleasant staff, clean rooms, great shower. While our room didn’t have a view of the Acropolis, the roof top bar/restaurant did. Some great cocktails, sensational food as well. (Not the place to go in a hurry - like most places in Greece). Really the only downside to this hotel was space in the room. Bed was comfortable, marble bathroom, just small with no storage. We didn’t unpack as really no drawers or cupboard space and none in the bathroom. This is a small price to pay for everything else it has going for it. We were very happy and glad to save the extra $1000 for a “nicer” room in a different hotel (4 nights).","June 9, 2019","2    Herodion Hotel

The sitting room was nice, with couch, chairs and a wall mounted TV (also one in the bedroom). The bathroom was adequately sized (though counter space is limited), the shower was large. The rooms, halls, and lobby were all very clean. The included breakfast was good, with a variety of fruits, eggs, meats, traditional Greek foods, etc. The front desk staff was most accommodating, as were all staff that we encountered. The lounge, just off the lobby, is especially nice, with good seating, an excellent bar, and numerous games and other activities to amuse.

130,"The Heridion is everything you need in a hotel, location, hospitality, friendliness and reflects the city it is in.Although the rooms are very small, they have everything you need. The hotel is right next to the street that the Acropolis Museum is in and close to the plaka and the main pedestrian thoroughfare around the bottom of the Acropolis. You are close to everything but not amongst the bustle so it is perfect.I would get up and run every morning and as Athens is a late starting city, I would often be jogging around the Acropolis with just a few other runners and a few dogs and cats for company. It was magical. No bustle and plenty of stunning sites as you made your way through the route.I would highly recommend the hotel's roof top restaurant. The food was amongst the best we had in Greece and the view of the Acropolis as the sun went down was worth being there alone. A wide variety of interesting Greek wines could also be sampled. Service could have been a touch friendlier but with that view, a minor thing.This will be my new ""go to"" hotel in Athens. Highly recommended.","June 2, 2019","2    Herodion Hotel

But standing at the sink I couldn’t end over to brush my teeth since I would bump against the shower wall. And sitting on the toilet I could rest my chin on the sink. Even the elevator holds a maximum of only 4 people uncomfortably close together.But other than the cramped quarters, this place is top notch in every other way.

Although not the biggest room in a city hotel we only slept & showered there so it was more than adequate. The breakfast each day was plentiful with Greek, continental & cooked items to choose from along with tea coffee juices & hot water. We did test out the hot tub but it was a breezy cloudy day so not an ideal time to try! The roof bar was being refurbished over winter but the lounge bar was lovely & cosy with squashy sofas & an open fire on chillier evenings - they make a good Pornstar Martini cocktail too ;-) The hotel itself is a few minutes walk from Acropolis subway station and it’s very easy to walk to all of the main attractions from here with lots of shops & restaurants nearby.

And the view is the street. the division on each room is not concrete so you can hear other people talking in the other room. The tv is only 24 inches, so you need to get near to tv for you to watch. The toilet is small and they’re very stingy on toilet papers. 3. There’s 2 jacuzzi in 4th floor and operated by getting card in the front desk and according to them it last 30 mins but when we used it, it only last 15 mins and you need to call them on telephone to bring new card. 4. The breakfast is terrible. Very few variety of meal. And the orange juice is not fresh. There’s a lot of oranges in the street and they can’t make fresh orange juice, that’s crazy. 5. The restaurant is not good. Less variety of food and no Greek food. That’s ridiculous we’re in Greece and no Greek food!6. The elevator is tiny.

There was a filled mini-bar with a complete supply of water, soda, beer, various spirits and even a small champagne/fizzy wine.

The roof top bar had been refurbished recently and was incredible and the staff up there were excellent especially the older Gentleman that worked the Bar and the Breakfast area. The views over the Acropolis and Athens were stunning and an absolute highlight of the property. There was a lot of graffiti in the street and first impressions was that the property looked old and run down however once inside it was modern and very well presented (we found this to be similar in most places in Athens) while this location was excellent. The reception was OK and the staff were friendly but didn’t go out of their way to help. we needed a taxi booked for an early morning trip to the port to catch a ferry and we told them that we needed a large taxi to accommodate all the luggage for 4 people and all that turned up was a rather small taxi. Rooms were on the small side but very clean and beds were large and comfortable. The bathroom was good, shower was Ok and a reasonable size.

167,15 minute walk to the Acropolis and lovely view from the rooftop restaurant/bar so well worth having dinner here in the evening - need to reserve a table . Staff - as you expect in Greece - are very friendly and helpful. The room was very tight and the 2x3 metre mirror opposite the bed - which presumably is to give a sense of depth - is just weird... could create the same effect without going full length.

We easily moved to a good, quiet room, 204.Breakfast was fine: scrambled eggs, great bread, cereals, dried and fresh fruit, cakes, but I was annoyed about the croissants which seemed to have become hard through micro-waving. No doubt I was spoilt by Hotel de Charme in Laveno, Italy. The coffee set-up was also disappointing.We soon realised this hotel's location is the big plus point - 15 mins walk to the Acropolis and Museum, Odeon Herodes, so close to Syntagma Square, hop-on buses and metro back to airport, and on the edge of the Plaka district, a minute from the cathedral.Staff on reception and on the roof-top were always pleasant.","June 22, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

170,"The hotel is nice when you first walk in, although when we saw our rooms it was a little disappointing. There was a door to look outside but no balcony, it is almost like a tease. The air conditioning sucked so much! I would turn it up all the way and after hours of the A/C on the room was still hot and muggy and it seems I’m not the only guest that had this problem. The next thing I would let future guest know is that the “complimentary breakfast” wasn’t so good, the sausage was nasty, bacon was nearly raw (not crispy at all) and the eggs were so soft and mushy it was gross. Basically anything that was not a croissant was pretty disappointing. There was no pool nor hot tub instead they have a lounge on the roof which is very nice, although I would rather have a small pool on the roof along with a bar that would be more exciting. The best part about this hotel was the location in relation to the shops and the hotel service. The front desk guys work around the clock and were super helpful.

184,"Right, here it goes. Very unsure with how to rate this hotel whether to put it down as a 3 or 4 stars, so I’ve opted for 4 stars.We turned up to the hotel and the outside it’s opposite a busy food market which is lovely, a nicer sight to see every morning. But the location of the hotel is excellent, a 15-20 minute walk from the acropolis and Plaka and a 5 minute walk from Monastiraki. But the area where it’s located is where all the immigrants live. I’m far from a snob but it’s dirty, dark and full of men leering around, it made me and my family very uneasy walking back here at night, so keep an eye on your pockets.The lobby is nothing spectacular but sometimes simple is better, we went to check in and the man was rather rude behind reception as he didn’t understand much English, but we spoke to a younger lady and she spoke good English and was more friendly. The lifts are tiny, there’s only two of them and could only fit two people in with suitcases and even that’s a tight squeeze.The rooms are very clean, rather modern and spacious. I love that they had air corn and provided toiletries (soap, shampoo, shower gel). The downside to the rooms was that when we book a double room, we expect a double bed and not two single beds pushed together. They have a roof top terrace with tables and chairs, sun beds and a bar. We a splendid view. The view of the acropolis is amazing and you also have a beautiful view of the rest of the city. It’s also open until late (midnight).The breakfast was ample, nothing amazing but it had everything you needed to fill your stomach for a long day ahead of you. A mix between hot food and continental and coffee and juice. The tables are very limited so if you have breakfast try and go as early or as late as you can to ensure you have a space.Overall, the hotel was quite nice. So it’s lovely hotel with clean rooms, a good breakfast and perfect location. It’s worth the money.","May 27, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

We had a view of the Acropolis from our window on the fifth floor and the terrace bar upstairs has a great view as well, although they weren’t particularly welcoming when we went to look when we first arrived. It’s a shame they don’t offer guests a complimentary glass of wine up there to encourage patronage. Instead there is complimentary liqueur in the small clean rooms with good mattresses and hot shower. Reception staff were efficient but not overly friendly. Breakfast was on the lower floor in a big well decorated modern restaurant area, however the food was average. If I could have given 3 1/2 I would have but it’s definitely not s 4 in my opinion.

187,"We stayed here the first week of May. It’s a short 7 minute walk to Syntagma metro station on a quiet side street. The area may look seedy on first glance, but it is 100% safe! The hotel room is very basic and small, but that is all we needed as we were out and about all day. The location of the hotel allowed for us to take a break in the room at times before journeying off to explore during the day.You are less than 5 minutes walk from many quality restaurants and shops. Breakfast was very good with many options. Room was very clean during the stay and thermostat was able to be adjusted easily for comfort.

188,"Nice clean Hotel which would suit both the business traveller and tourist alike. Room was bright and modern, and our room overlooked the Acropolis, although no balcony, it was easy to see and admire. Breakfast was comprehensive with cooked option such as bacon , eggs, baked beans etc. as well as cold meats and cheeses. There was also yoghurt with honey, cereals and fresh fruit. If you had breakfast, you wouldn't have to eat until dinner. The attractions of the Plaka district are a short walk away, namely restaurants and the touristy shops as well as the Flea markets.Syntagma square was also a short walk away, with many buses having a stop there, including the X96 to the airport, which was 6 euros, whereas the Subway to the airport was 10 Euros.","May 17, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

Upon arrival, check-in was smooth, quick and efficient. Lobby looked new. Location was good - walking distance to major attractions. The rooftop was also closed for renovations at this time. Elevator was super slow (and stopped working at one point). Our room was quite small and the space was not functional, but the room was clean. The bathroom also had a damp/mildewy smell. Wifi in the hotel room was weak - could only access it in the lobby.

195,"Stayed here with my mother for three nights in September 2018. After arriving in the early hours of the morning we were thankful that the hotel had an area where we could rest until our room was ready. We were also able to make use of the buffet breakfast that morning during our wait, something that we did each morning during our stay because it was delicious! A great amount of choice & always stocked well. We were then notified at about 9am that our room was ready, well before the usual 2pm check-in time & we were so thankful to the staff for making this happen. The room itself was basic but neat & clean. The beds were a little hard, but the room had a view of The Acropolis so what more could we ask for! One small complaint about the room was that it overlooked a school. This meant that there were loud bells that went off multiple times a day, but this was a minor issue for us (who comes to Greece to spend all day in their room anyway!) The hotel itself is perfectly located, walking distance to all attractions & in a safe area. The rooftop terrace was definitely our highlight though. It had an unforgettable view of The Acropolis & was the perfect place for a drink & some food whilst admiring the sunset. It was a little expensive but worth it for at least one special night! All in all we would definitely return, a great hotel to base yourself while you explore this magnificent city!","May 10, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

203,"Stayed at this hotel in Athens for 4 days in the middle of February. The neighborhood is quaint and offers views of the Acropolis from the rear of the hotel. Unfortunately the roof bar/restaurant was under construction during our visit - scheduled to be finished in mid March so upcoming visitors will be the first to enjoy the renovations. The hotel is truly centrally located - we were able to walk to all subway lines within 10 minutes. There are multiple restaurants in the local neighborhood and the Plaka/Flea Market area are within a 10 minute walk as well. An additional 20 eateries lie within and/or near the Flea Market. Regarding the hotel, we stayed in a Superior Double Room on the 4th floor. The room checked off all the boxes - clean, comfy bed, and relatively quiet on the back side of the motel. I say relatively because their is a grade/middle school on the back side of the hotel - the sound of ringing school bells is heard throughout the day as students move between classes and recesses (and on Saturday too -- apparently they go to school on the weekends in Greece). Some will be shocked by the overall size of the room - it is cozy but typical for European standards...meaning their is not a lot of extra space in the room - and the bathroom was a bit tight for my liking but manageable for the brief period of time spent in the location on a daily basis. The breakfast buffet was wonderful - new/different warm dishes daily. I was expecting the European standard of yogurt, cheese, breads, and various cereal grains -- so this was a wonderful bonus! Staff are exceedingly polite and helpful. Our room was cleaned daily and we were impressed with the housekeeping services. We would definitely stay again.","February 26, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

204,"Was on a short holiday to Athens and stayed here as a central base so could seem the most of the city. It is an excellent location- in walking distance to the Acropolis, main shoping and tourist area an the the main square of the city and metro station . We have a fantastic night view of the Acropolis from the rooftop bar open I think until 11pm. One can take a taxi from the airport at Euro 55 but it is easier to take the very efficient and new metro (euro 10) and a short 7 min walk. from Syntagma Square. There are also buses but it also depends on time of travel . The hotel rooms are very spacious but my room faced inside and saw only some pipes . The room has a good bath , internet and a comfortable bed. The sofa was a bit sunk in possibly by overuse but ok. A nice work table and spacious. The elevator/ lift is VERY small and can accomodate only 3 persons at a time . This is the only negative I saw in the hotel - as it is frequently busty and you need to wait unless yo prefer to climb up by the stairs. Breakfast is on the mezzanine floor and a good spread of hot and cold stuff including eggs to order. But with such lovely variety of greek food as options - you may also want to walk around the area in Plaka and find nice bakeries and small shops if you want explore. I walked through the area right upto to the Acropolis a pleasant 20 minute walk (with a climb) and saw the Acropolis museum ( sunday free) and the Acropolis the high point of my visit. Reception at the Hotel is helpful and directs well on places to see. It was a good base to come back to as the hotel is a central base for travelling everywhere .","February 14, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

Breakfast staff efficient but, again, cool. Breakfast spread quite abundant, and breakfast space rather pleasant. It was cold and rainy during our stay, so we did not visit the rooftop, unfortunately. This is a pretty big hotel, and the elevator is woefully inadequate (holds two small people, without luggage, at a time). It is clear that guests were smoking in their rooms (despite ""no smoking"" signs) without consequence. But here's the biggie: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PUT A REAL DOOR ON THE BATHROOM. There is a sort of swinging, non-latching foggy-glass partition that doesn't even go all the way to the floor. Fine if you're with someone you've been married to for 30 years, but even then, perhaps a little too intimate, if you catch my drift.

Train station is a 5 minute walk away. The location was very good with many restaurants, shops and sites all within an easy walking distance. The staff were very courteous and friendly, we had asked for a room facing the Acropolis and that is what we got. The view of course was fantastic because of this. We also got to hotel early and they allowed us to check-in with no problems. We booked a Superior double room and it was a fair size, clean and bright with lots of mirrors to make it appear bigger than it was. The bathroom was small but clean and the shower had plenty of hot water. The room was very quiet, no noise issues at all. The only complaint was the elevator, it was the smallest that we’ve seen in our travels, I’m a little claustrophobic so I took the stairs.We had an early flight to Santorini so we didn’t experience the breakfast. We informed the front desk about this the night before and they were kind enough to pack a breakfast for us to go , much appreciated. We tried booking the hotel on the way back but unfortunately there were no rooms available. We stayed at another nearby hotel and it wasn’t anywhere close to what we had experienced at the Central.

222,"This was an excellent choice for my family. The check-in was quick and the staff so kind.We had 3 rooms. They were not fancy but did the job. Very clean and beds were great. Bathroom was fine. The best part of this hotel is the LOCATION. It is ""Central"" to walk to almost anything you want to see. You must go to the rooftop. This hotel is very close to the Acropolis. It's a beautiful view during the day but at night, simply astonishing. The rooftop offers food and drinks and was very very good. The staff was excellent. My dream has always been to see Athens and my dream came true. I would stay here again. They offered a free breakfast buffet which was good. Since we left so early in the morning, the provided each of us with a sack lunch when we checked out. What a surprise. Thank you everyone for making our stay so nice.","October 16, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

223,"When I checked in, they said I had two reservations. They claimed I had made a second reservation through Trip Advisor that I never made. I have since contacted Trip Advisor, and they have no record of said reservation. I explained to the day manager that I only had one reservation. (Why would I need two?) He said he couldn't do anything and that I had to PAY FOR TWO RESERVATIONS! Not only did he not try to help me AT ALL, he was very RUDE. Since Trip Advisor is not responsible, I am now trying to work with my bank to get the charge off my credit card, but I'm not sure if I will be successful. This hotel may be in a good location, but their ETHICS and treatment of guests are NOT WORTH IT.","October 15, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

224,"We stayed at the Central Athens for 3 nights from Sept 22 - 25. We were greeted with a delicious liqueur and Greek Delights. The room had a small balcony ledge where we could open the double doors and have a beautiful view of the Acropolis. The room was very modern and immaculate. The bathroom was small but functional. The only think I didn't love was the bathroom door was a more like a folding closet door lacking a bit of a privacy.The Central Athens is within walking distance to EVERYTHING: Acropolis, Plaka, Monistraki, Syntagma, Thissio, shopping, restaurants. The roof top bar is spectacular and the nighttime view of the Acropolis is stunning.","October 14, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

225,"We only had one night to spend in Central Athens and selected this hotel. It is in a great location to restaurants, shopping and offers a splendid view of the Acropolis! The room was small (compared to the US), but very modern and clean. The price was very reasonable. They arranged airport pickup for us and our driver (holding a card with our name) was wonderful! He was very informative during our drive. It was like a personal tour of Athens! We had to depart at 5am the next morning and the hotel prepared a nice bag of food for breakfast ""to go""! We shared it with our driver because they packed enough for several people! How nice!The view from the rooftop bar at night was PERFECT!

227,"The hotel name says it all: a centrally located hotel in the Plaka district of Athens. Three other couples and ourselves stayed for three days and all agreed it met our travel needs. We could walk to most any place we wanted to see.This is important because traffic in Athens is heavy and the streets are narrow and not well marked. The rooms were small and clean with comfortable beds.The hotel staff was helpful and were ready to answer our questions The daily breakfast was generous and had Greek and American choices. The views from the roof top bar looked great but because of high winds and rain, we were not able to spend much time there .I recommend this great hotel for its location, breakfast and comfort.","October 8, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

All the places you want to visit like Monastiraki, Plaka, Parthenonas are just nearby. The famous shopping area located in the center, Ermou and Mitripoleos street just a breath away. Some steps further up is the Syntagma square, Kolonaki, Voukourestiou. All the streets nearby are full of cozy cafes, restaurants, bars. A city that never sleeps!

229,"We only spent one night here but as soon as we arrived we were very happy with our experience. First off, our room was ready early which was such a nice treat after being on a flight for 10 hours. We were also very surprised to find that our room had a view of the Acropolis which we were definitely not expecting. The location is perfect for exploring the major sites in Athens by foot with lots of restaurants and shops close-by. The rooftop bar is a definite must, we watched the sunset while enjoying drinks here and it was just wonderful. One thing to note is that there is only one elevator and it is very small so we usually took the stairs to avoid waiting forever. Aside from that, I would definitely recommend this hotel!","October 3, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

231,"We didn't stay here on our recent visit*, but the rooftop bar is always where we start our evenings. We've always been lucky to get a table with an amazing view, but try to arrive before the sunset to pick your spot. Order an appetizer and a glass of wine, then watch the Acropolis magically light up in slow motion as the twilight fades. You're high above the noise of the city with box seats for the dramatic light show. *We stayed in the hotel several years ago and I remember the rooms being very tidy and efficient with a wonderful breakfast.","September 30, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

233,"Central hotel is in a thin building wedged in between two broader ones. It’s one of those hotels where everything is micro and stylish, and lots of mirrors are needed to give the illusion of extra space. Upon arrival,we took a teeny-tiny elevator that has a maximum capacity of three teeny-tiny people up to our room. We were delighted to find that if we looked out our window at just the right angle we could actually see a teeny-tiny sliver of the Parthenon. In the teeny-tiny bathroom there was a teeny-tiny shower. There was a teeny-tiny square of hand soap and two teeny-tiny tubes of body gel, but not even one teeny-tiny washcloth. In the bedroom there was a teeny-tiny 20” tv screen and there was also a spotty, teeny-tiny WiFi signal. At least two or three times a day, we heard a teeny-tiny bell letting us know that someone was stuck in the teeny-tiny elevator. It all made me wish I had paid more attention at home when I was watching teeny Tiny House Nation on my huge ginormous flat-screen tv. But The next morning we took the teeny-tiny elevator to the huge ginormous free buffet breakfast (cereal, eggs, yogurt, pastries, and much more, all very nicely prepared) and then went up to the huge ginormous rooftop garden where we had a huge ginormous view of the acropolis just a teeny-tiny distance away. And the staff was helpful and even provided a boxed breakfast for us for our early morning departure on our last day, and the location was great, so in the end we decided it didn’t all matter that much, since in coming to Athens we always planned to spend most of our time in the huge ginormous city and only a teeny-tiny amount of time in our teeny-tiny hotel.","September 29, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

236,"We stayed here in late August for one night when we returned from Meteora and before our departure to the Islands. The hotel is centrally located in the heart of Plaka and in walking distance to the Acropolis. The rooms are remodeled and are very clean and comfortable though a bit too small. This was not an issue for us as we only stayed here for one night. We had to leave at 6AM so we did not get to try the hotel's breakfast but the receptionists were so nice and had the kitchen employees pack for us sandwiches, pastries, and juices. We LOVED the rooftop bar. The view of the acropolis from the rooftop is lovely and it was very convenient to relax at the bar before walking to dinner. There are hundreds of cool restaurants and bars just around the hotel. We found the receptionists attitude and service to be superb. We definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again if and when visiting Athens again","September 23, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

237,"My sister, daughter and I stayed here one night while in Athens to see the Acropolis. The positive points are the rooftop bar with a lovely view of the Acropolis, clean room, the nice breakfast & most of the staff. The negatives were the gentleman behind the front desk when we checked in. I don’t know his name but he was very unfriendly and when we asked questions, he gave the impression we were bothering him. We checked in around lunchtime on a Tuesday. Also, the elevator is, well, ridiculously small. Hopefully no one ever gets stuck in that elevator! The room was quite small and the beds were very hard. Glad we were only there for one night. The location is good but didn’t feel like we were in a very nice area of Athens.","September 22, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

238,"We found this hotel to be in a good location for getting around Athens. Walking distance to so much! The rooms were enough for us space wise and had a side view to the Acropolis. We had a little issue with our room the first night where the air did not work. We were given two fans to get us through the night and were told they would have a technician come out in the morning. If that didn't fix it they would move us to another room. We survived the first night once we got fans! The next morning we were moved to another room right next to the first one. The air was much better! I find it interesting that the next night someone else was in our ""broken"" room. Maybe they got it fixed. I hope! I think a good thing that travelers should know is that this hotel does not provide washcloths. That was a little shock to us. We were able to buy some natural sponges on our outings to the shops. The rooftop bar has amazing views of the Acropolis. Great spot for pictures. Espcially in the evening with the sun setting.","September 21, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

Would be better if it had baked beans for the cooked breakfast but they rarely do in Europe.P.s. Would recommend a day/half day trip to Sounion. Public bus is 12.50 EUR return (pay on board).

The good points: great location, friendly staff, good price compared to other hotels in the area, breakfast included, nice balcony, free wifi. The bad points: the lobby smelled badly of smoke, uncomfortable bed. Fortunately our room and the breakfast area did not smell like smoke. The room was very basic and was a little outdated.

241,"The week previous, we had paid more to stay at the awful Athens Cypria hotel a few streets away- please read my review. We then went off to the islands and came back to Athens Central for one night and we were very happy with this hotel. They kindly minded our luggage while we were gone for free. (We just took little backpacks to the islands).Central was clean and although our room was small, it was very adequate for our needs. We were on the 1st floor so could walk up the stairs (elevator very, very slow). Our room had a balcony, which was its saving grace as it made the small room seem a bit more spacious when the doors were open. It was nice to sit on the balcony and watch Athens wake up in the morning. Internet in room was slow.Rooftop bar had a lovely view of the Pantheon. There is also an unheated jacuzzi which I imagine would be nice to come back to in the hot summer months.Breakfast was plentiful and suited us fine.The location is fabulous. We walked from the train station easily. Close by for shopping, eating and drinking. We happened upon some very cool bars in courtyards close to the hotel.Staff were welcoming and efficient.

There also isn't much space for weights or stretching etc. It was also very warm, even very early in the morning. The AC didn't seem to do much either.

258,"My family and I recently stayed at the Wyndham Grand for about 4 days. The hotel is quite nice, with great amenities and a fantastic restaurant on the top floor with 360 degree views and a pool. One particularly nice experiance was dinner. The views of the Acropolis are breathtaking, and the Above Team takes great care of you. Konstantinos, the Above Manager, is very attentive and has a great knowledge of the city and its history, which he is happy to share if you are interested. Moreover, he has an extensive knowledge of wines native to Greece and made a great recommendation for a light white wine to complement our delicious meal. Thank you Konstantinos and Georgia, and really the whole Above Team for such a memorable dinning experiance. We will certainly recommend it to any of our friends traveling to Athens.","July 2, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

259,"Stayed at Wyndham Grand for three nights with my family. We found a five stars hotel in Athens' city center with all its services and four stars rates. Enjoy your breakfast on the rooftop with a 360° view on the capital, surrounded by its white until the blue of the sea, with the shade of Aegina at the horizon. Look at the Acropolis, right in front of you, and at the Lycabettus, on your left. You can also relax and enjoy the sun at the swimming pool.No suggestion, maybe only one: both rooms and bathrooms are large but, maybe, the pavement's inclination into the shower should be increased. If you got close showers (something normal for a family) water tends getting out and spreads into the bathroom.This five stars hotel has its best at the reception. Indeed, if the front office is any hotel's business card and what the guest will remember as first, Wyndham Grand has its own strenght in it. I am talking about all the receptionists and the staff at the entrance, but with a special mention for Angie, that completely demonstrated how carefully, professionally and nicely you can receive your guests. The Wyndham scored having and her smile as the first thing you see coming in. The last of my five points is only for her! Thank you Angie! ","July 1, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

267,"Booked our hotel through British Airways Holidays for a one week stay in Athens. Arrived at hotel and were immediately upgraded, an unexpected surprise. Staff at check-in, professional and helpful. Our room 816 was immaculate, large and spacious with city views and all of the amenities expected of a 5 star hotel. The rooftop bar, terrace and restaurant have spectacular views over the Acropolis and Lycabettus. The rooftop also has a beautiful swimming pool which although not large is perfect for a swim after a days sightseeing and an added bonus for city hotel. Restaurant and bar provide high quality food with service to match as does room service ( beware the club sandwich, which is delicious but huge) This hotel also has a excellent spa, which we would highly recommend. The hotel is located next to the metro (which is reasonable and easy to use) taxi rank outside, which will take you to Plaka and monastriraki districts (both worth a visit) for less than 5 euros.

271,"I have logged many miles and hotel stays for work and vacations and typically I ignore reviews that are this level of negative, but I write this as a seasoned traveler. I realize an experience like this won't happen to most, but know that by making a reservation at the Wyndham Grand Athens...it could happen to you. I would give a negative number as a rating if I could.I made a reservation for a junior suite, which by the pictures had extra room for a crib as my wife and I were traveling with our son who is 1.5 years old. In my reservation I noted that we would be arriving late in the evening and as noted, we made it to the hotel at 11:30pm. Having just traveled 4700 miles, the three of us were so relieved to arrive and rest. Instead of greeting us with room keys we were met by a front desk clerk who told us that as of 2 hours prior to our arrival, the water in our room stopped working. They were trying to fix it but were unable to. I have thought about this in the 24 hours since, as I write this review. So a single room in a ""five star"" hotel has an issue with plumbing that there is no water service to the room? And they can't fix it? It is hard for me to understand how that happens. Bottom line there was no room for us. I will say they made a reservation for us at a nearby ""comparable"" hotel (ended up having to switch rooms there bc it was anything but comparable). In the moment I was so exhausted I hardly had the energy to point out how absurd the situation was. An excuse that there is no running water in the room sounds more ridiculous the more I think about it. In the moment that evening I just wanted to get my family showered and in bed so I just went with it, not much else to do. The excuse that there was no running water is downright unbelievable. After telling people about what happened, their immediate response was, the water was fine, they probably gave your room away. I had come to this conclusion myself and this just confirmed it. No running water in a single room is ludicrous and unimaginable.They did provide a taxi at no cost but in my opinion that was totally missing the point. This was beyond an inconveniece. It was a poor excuse and unacceptable management. In the end we had a horrible experience at the Wyndham Grand Athens (and we didn't even stay there!) and an unacceptable stay at the other hotel. A hotel employee actually ended up entering our room in the morning as we slept, walked past a crib with a sleeping child and into the bedroom my wife and I were sleeping in. If I didn't live these events I would not believe it.Thank you if you have read this far!!! Wyndham Grand Athens management I hope you have too and I eagerly look forward to your response, in which I'm sure you will repeat your absurd excuse that the water mysteriously stopped working. I know this review is a total outlier. I take these extremely negative reviews for hotels with a grain of salt when doing online research for myself. I get that most people will have a better experience, I just wanted to let people know this type of thing can happen. Thanks for reading. I hope your stay in Athens starts better than ours!","June 4, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

272,"We stayed here for three nights. Actually, we were looking for a place close to the Acropolis but followed the overwhelming positive reviews of this property. It’s a standard and practical hotel. We found a nice square a few minutes off (great restaurant called Egg of the Rooster and a bar called Blue Parrot). But you do need to be aware that it is not the best area to walk through even though my husband was more put off than I was. You will find the usual graffiti, some needles lying around (no panic, please! ) but the square is brilliant! So be aware of your surroundings but do it! Would also recommend the metro or taxi to Plaka versus walking - we had an encounter with a pick-pocketer when walking back on the morning at around 11am, no big deal but it’s there. Fine during the day, at night a ‘no-no’. For the hotel, service could be better. Housekeeping at 6pm, roof top terrace is nice but strangely angled. Service here is slow albeit very friendly.

277,"The service and stay at this beautiful hotel was impeccable! Upon our arrival in Athens, we caught a taxi from the airport (our driver was very professional and courteous, he offered wonderful information about the area and provided information about places where we could tour). Check-in at the front desk was wonderful (we checked-in along with another couple we were traveling with, Alexandria, assisted us with our check-in, while the other couple was assisted by another associate)! Our rooms were very comfortable and clean! We actually could view the Acropolis from our room, it was such a beautiful view, night and day! Our first evening, we ate at Alexander the Great, right across the street from the hotel (just about everything is within walking distance of the Wyndham), we had a wonderful time and meal! After our meal, we returned to our hotel for cocktails. The second evening we dined at the hotel, where we received wonderful service, our server as well as the manager were very professional and made us feel so welcomed and appreciated as we dined! The meal was delicious, so was the view of the Acropolis! The ended the evening with a wonderful night cap, suggested by the manager, it WAS WONDERFUL! The best ""bang"" for our buck was the Hop-On, Hop-Off tour with the Blue Line! We paid $15 each for the tour, that included a walking tour of the city! OH MY GOODNESS, the walking tour was such a treat, I do believe I fell in love with Athens during our walking tour! Two tips: you do not need to drive in this area, just catch the taxi/walk (I'm not sure about certain areas at night, however, we felt safe/comfortable throughout the day). Please do not engage the street vendors/pan-handlers, unless you have true intentions of buying from them/giving them coin. Of the four places we visited during our European trip (Germany, Paris, Athens, and Burgundy), Athens was my favorite, it was just something so spiritual/uplifting about this place.","May 21, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

278,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand on three occasions recently, and we were pleasantly surprised. We rented a junior suite, on the 8th floor, on all three stays. The rooms were all beautiful, huge suites (at least by European standards), with stunning views of the Acropolis. The dining room, on the 9th floor, was beautifully appointed, with very good food. Breakfasts (included) tended to be crowded, but not excessively so. The dining room had the same great views. The staff were superb-- very friendly, and competent. After our first visit they remembered us, greeting us with ""welcome backs"", and that's always pleasing. We picked this hotel because they advertise that they provide ""affordable luxury"", and they mean it. If it were in San Francisco, this place would sell its rooms for four times the prices they charge. It's a bargain, and the next time we're in Athens we'll certainly stay there again. The only negative is the surrounding neighborhood is very run down, and I wouldn't walk far at night. But taxis are plentiful and not expensive, so walking is not a necessity. The fish restaurant just across the street is quite good and inexpensive. Walking there is not a problem, but I wouldn't venture much further on foot.","May 20, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

They told me they are sorry and they will check again and call me back as they find. We arrange that I will pass to pick them and when I did I had to wait more than 30 minutes to find them so I had to live without them. The customer service is kind and polite but terrible. <br/>*As I arrange with the front desk I came back 7 hours later to pick them up from the front desk as I had agreed but unfortunately they were misplaced!!

I travel few times a year; we all visit different locations around the world, but this is the first time in my travel life that I have remembered most people that greeted me at this hotel, and that is all because of their kindness and excellent customer service:1. Angela Toto: the lead supervisor at customer service: always polite, helpful (and she meant it) and tried her best to accommodate my hotel requests.2. Aggeliki: in Customer Relations: this girl spent more than an hour of her time to help me call different places to get my refund when my trip to Santorini got cancelled. True kindness! Thank you a million! ٌYou are an angel!3. Dimitrius, front door staff: always smiling and polite and so courteous and caring. 4. Alexandra, Christina and Despina5. The gentleman as part of front door staff, his name I can not recall, start with K! Polite and helpful.6. Alexandros in restaurant: sweet person with great customer service.7. Constanstinos, restaurant manager: great guy, with quality character that made the visit to the awesome restaurant so memorable! The hotel location is very good, close to subway and easy access. Well maintained, decent and clean. My first room was really good. Per my request, they managed to give me a better room. The second time I checked in, the room was ok, but small. They tried but due to high occupancy, it was not doable to get me a better one. The breakfast was fantastic! Great variety and quality. Service was amazing (especially that I did not receive such a good experience when I was in Milan last year). The restaurant (both for breakfast and at night) has an amazing view of Acropolis and Parthenon. On 9th floor with a swimming pool that unfortunately was closed due to colder weather. The dinner was great with great ambient music and breathtaking view of Parthenon.If I go back to Greece and Athens (which is very likely), I will stay at this hotel again for sure, and I hope most amazing people that I met here will be there in next visit!Thank you all so very much to make my trip memory so memorable!

I even tried the room service and the burger has the same breakfast potatoes as during the breakfast. The breakfast has a good variety but they are using some olive oil or something and everything tastes the same. They have no egg station and all the prepaid omelets, fried eggs etc are semi warm or even cold. On the regular menu there is no Greek food just a Greek salad, chicken leg, pork, burger, pasta very boring menu. I went to the roof top bar in the evening and wanted cheese plate and a glass of wine. They have no cheese plate or anything similar just cheese and ham sandwich. At the lobby bar they make no coctails. I had issues with the room cleaning but this was rectified by the hotel. There is the red light district right in the next building. This is in a bit dangerous area and had some problems with the immigrants outside. Lots of drug addicts and needles everywhere when you go to the side next street. Some hassle with the taxis as well since they are refusing sometimes to put the meter on. The taxi station is front of the main entrance. Be careful with the shower floor since it can get really slippery when wet. It is just a plastic flooring.There is no supermarkets nothing close by no shopping only low end bad restaurants.

Also, some neighboring streets did not feel too safe so better take the metro to/from there.Would highly recommend for your stay in Athens! ","March 24, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

292,"We stayed in a gorgeous executive suite on the 6th floor. It's called an ""Acropolis View"" room. Know that the Acropolis is about a mile away, so it's a distant view. Nonetheless, when the Parthenon is lit up at night it is wonderful. The included breakfast buffet is served in a patio restaurant with an amazing view of Athens facing the ocean. We were astonished every morning at the view and enjoyed great food. The neighborhood is mixed. Not a place to go shopping or out to eat, but only a 15-minute walk from the Plaka marketplace, Mostraki market, and 30 min to walk to the Parthenon. Don't miss the Acropolis Museum.","March 22, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

294,"It was my birthday and we decided to stay in hotel with spa. Unfortunately it was the only looks like in the city and has a spa. Rooms are very small for two people, we had great view of Acropolis (I mean not sure why it is great:)). First day with a good mood we went walking to the city... oh noo.. it was sooo upsetting.. neighborhood was a disaster.. they offer forbitten stuff while u walking.. I was super scared.. now about spa, it is just a hotel room changed to .. something similar to spa.. we asked couple massage with full treatments and all of it for three hours actually.. one girl was super tired, the place is tiny..no again. Pool is outdoor but not a season. Breakfast was ok with nice view. So we always needed to take a taxi cause I never felt relaxed in this place to walk. They upgraded us, and they’ve done everything ontime for my birthday, I guess my partner asked. I stayed for New Year’s Eve in another hotel actually, so I don’t think I’ll come back to this hotel, just cause of location. But the staff was very very polite and helpful!!! Thanks to them!","March 19, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

295,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in February 2019. The staff was very friendly when we arrived and we received a coupon for a free 15 minute massage in the spa. We booked the massage and the ladies from the spa were so friendly!! They really took their time and made us feel very comfortable, even if they knowed we were not going to pay extra for a longer massage. The sauna was also very nice! Our room was very good and this was by far the best hotel bed I've ever slept in! The bathroom was clean with a very large (rain) shower. The breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had with lots of Greek specialities, which was very nice! The breakfast room was located at the very top of the hotel, with an incredible view of the Acropolis!! The hotel is located in a shady neighbourhood, but taxi's and Ubers are very cheap (4 euros to city center) and the metro is located 100 meters outside of the hotel. We always felt safe, but would not recommend to walk there alone at night. In summary: SUPER HOTEL!! Would definitely come back here next time we visit Athens!","March 3, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

296,"Our 5 night stay in Athens got off to a great start thanks in no small part to the warm welcome we received from the check-in desk. All the staff throughout our entire stay were lovely, without being irritatingly sycophantic as can sometimes happen. They were down to earth but wanted us to have the best stay possible for our wedding anniversary. To that end, they made sure we had a stunning view from our room - none other than the Acropolis itself. I would strongly recommend the Wyndham Grand to anyone. The area of the city itself is not the most scenic, but it's easy to imagine this hotel spurring a regeneration/gentrification of the local area. Transport links are fantastic (right next door to the Metro) and the breakfast caters to all tastes.","February 22, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

298,Big hotel near the old town. This is about 2.5 kms Acropolis which is a must see place in Athens. The staff was very welcoming and enthusiastic. Though this is my first time booking with this group of hotels they have upgraded me to a better room. I didn’t have breakfast there so I am not sure how it is. I liked the room. When I gave my feedback in the hotels.com that the room is noisy they immediately contacted me and offered to change it to a quieter room. Which is very much appreciated. Station near the hotel has no elevator or escalator. There are so many stairs. As I took trains (there is no direct train or bus) from the airport I felt it difficult to exit the station with 2 bags. If you are planning to take public transport from the airport then better to take train to the nearest station with elevator and then taxi. If you are planning to take taxi then you have no problem as they can send you a ride if you request one. I slipped in my bathroom. The surface is very smooth and slippery so plz be careful.Overall it is was a good stay.,"February 16, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

299,"What an amazing stay! I travel every week to a different country for business, and this stay was one of the most memorable! When I arrived with my colleague, we were greeted by very friendly staff, who with a genuine smile greeted us and made us feel welcome. The receptionist - Izabela (hope I spell the names right) was very kind and warm and made the check-in quick and pleasant. The room itself was very nice, spacious, clean and well equipped - my favorite so far in Athens hotels. Then we went to a pool bar at the top of the hotel - first thing I noticed was the beautiful view of the Acropolis, but that was not the most amazing part. The staff in the bar/restaurant was extraordinary and I have never received better service. The drinks were prepared by a very friendly bartender named Alexandros - who made sure, genuinely that we enjoyed them. Then, a manager of the bar himself came to introduce himself and make sure we are happy and taken care of properly - the man named Constantinos has personally greeted us every night we visited the bar (and we did not go to any other), and most importantly made us feel like we can feel at home there. Our last night of the stay we enjoyed a very cool party in the bar, although would be better if there was more staff, since the bar was quite popular. I will definitely come back to this hotel!","February 9, 2019","4    Wyndham Grand Athens

The staff really good and customer friendly, the interior of the room also very well, in particular, I like the bathroom. WiFi works well. So, I can recommend this place as good value for money. On another hand, there are some subjects to further improvement: 1. The breakfast is really modest. 2. in spite of the booking with free cancellation and payment at the property, the hotel charged my card for the 1 day immediately after booking confirmation. It is only the third time in my life when the hotel acts in such a manner. Then they say that they just validated the card - apparently standard EUR1 transaction doesn`t seem them as a sufficient for such purpose. 3. my request for the silent room was ignored.

While the staff are friendly and the rooms and bathroom in particular are very nice, the location is not nice at all, you couldn’t have the curtains open without been overlooked, and the breakfast was by far the worst we have had. There was little cutlery and or mugs to use, all the tables were covered in used plates that had not been cleared, and the food was reminiscent of a bad school meal rather than a hotel. I would recommend looking elsewhere.","June 20, 2019","5    Areos Hotel

308,"The Areos is a first rate hotel. I can hardly believe it has only three stars. I have stayed in much inferior four star hotels. There are so many good things to say about it but what made it outstanding was the staff. Usually I prepare thoroughly before going on a trip to a new place - guidebooks, websites and so on - but on this occasion I did not and so asked for information and suggestions form the reception staff. They were extremely helpful , giving recommendations for restaurants nearby and how to get around the city and how to get to the beaches. When we left they booked us a taxi to a station on the line to the airport so that we would not have to change. They always had time for our questions and were exceptionally professional and friendly. They all spoke very good English.Our room was a ""small double"" but it was much larger than rooms in many hotels we have stayed in. It was perfectly clean, the bed was comfortable and although it was on the road side of the building we were not disturbed by traffic at all. There were plenty of lights so reading at night was not a problem. There was a fridge with a couple of bottles of water provided. The bathroom was a decent size and had a good shower. It had a large wash basin and a plug that worked - not something that can be assumed in Southern Europe. There was no safe in the room reception was happy to keep some important documents for us.The hotel is not in the busiest tourist area and so by walking round the area we got a feel for the ""real"" Athens. The nearest metro station is Victoria which is a ten minute walk away. Breakfast in the hotel was adequate but not outstanding - the only thing about the Areos that I would categorise as merely ""good"". Curiously there was no fresh milk, only yoghurt for the cereal and German-style cartons of processed milk for the coffee. Perhaps this is a Greek thing.I did not realy enjoy my 4 day trip to Athens but this had nothing to do with the hotel. I can only recommend that visitors take extra care of their belongings, especially on the metro from the airport. I had my wallet stolen from the front pocket of my trousers (where I thought it would be perfectly safe) when changing trains. It seems that this is a frequent occurrence. I would suggest that you keep your cards, documents and cash separate from each other. Theives seem to be interested only in cash and mobile phones. If you hold your backpacks in front of your body rather than on your back it may make it harder for theives to get at any of the contents. The Hotel Areos was a very good hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.","June 20, 2019","5    Areos Hotel

It would’ve been nice to be given a little info about the area. The bed is two twin beds put together, which inevitably leads to a crevice. The pillows are fine. There was no safe in our room or coffee /tea machine. And there was no shower just a tub with a handle spray so you kind of awkwardly have to shower with one hand. The breakfast is a highlight and the guy overnight - 6am shift was the only front desk person that ever acknowledged us leaving or even smiled us.

333,"I stayed in athen with my husband for 1 day and we booked this hotel. And i must say, i was impressed.THE STAFFS WERE SUPER FRIENDLY :First of all, i came to the hotel early and i asked whether i can get an early checkin (most hotel that i stayed in europe asked for extra fees to do an early check in) since my luggage was broken somehow during the flight and i couldnt get around with a broken luggage, and the staff was so helpful, he gave me a free early check in and an upgrade for our room.THE ROOMThe room was nice with a mini balcony and the view was great too. The room was not that spacious but it was enough for us, the bath room was spacious and clean. The water worked really well. And they provided towel and toiletries too. THE BREAKFASTquite of options, juice are good, bread and pastry were nice. THE SERVICEVery helpful staffs and friendly. They lend me a phone to make a local phone call to my airline to settle my flights for free. Oh my god this hotel is really nice and one of a kind. Overall i highly recommend to stay in this hotel if you ever visit athens.

335,"This is a lovely hotel within easy walking distance of Parthenon and the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. It's also just a short ride from the center of town and Syntagma Square.The rooms vary in size, mine being one of the smaller, but very comfortable rooms. While some overlook the Parthenon my view was a lot that had an old building and overgrown lot. I intended to only spend time sleeping so the view was of no concern. The room was very clean, great air conditioning, and more than comfortable. The hotel provided needed amenities including shower caps, shampoo, hair conditioner, lotion, Greek olive oil soap, a small sewing kit, and other necessities. There was a nice sized flat screen television which had a USB port that I used for charging my phone and table. The bed was firm, but not uncomfortably so. I couldn't hear any noise from other rooms or outside, a plus for sure.A a healthy and tasty continental breakfast is provided, including Greek yogurt, eggs, various breads - both sweet and plain, fruits and of course juices, coffee and tea.I would recommend this hotel and definitely consider staying again.","June 1, 2018","5    Areos Hotel

336,"Areos Hotel is a small hotel that delivers a lot of value, and most of all they deliver a level of service well above the cost of the room. First class..... while the rooms are a little small by USA standard, they are very comfortable and fill any needs for folks traveling to Athens. The breakfast is way more that USA standards !!!! Great start to the day of sightseeing. Very easily located, if you buy the City Sightseeing bus tour $18Euro the stop is around the corner at the museum and that will take you to all the sights in Athens for the day...or taxi - very cheap too ... again a great stay, and would highly recommend (and i am very picky, so this is a great value - just disregard the graffiti as this is part of a free culture in the area)","June 1, 2018","5    Areos Hotel

341,"I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels, and I’ve come to realize that the entire star system doesn’t mean all that much. Hotels are given points based on things like whether or not it has a restaurant, which really means nothing about the quality of the hotel itself. I’ve stayed in two star hotels that have been quite nice. At the same time, I’ve stayed in four star hotels that were run down and disappointing. This place is rated three stars, but I’d say it’s quite a bit nicer than that. Everything was clean and modern, with new fixtures and a very spacious shower. I read one review where someone complained about the lack of slippers being provided, and...really? You need someone to tuck you in at night too?I think my only real suggestion would be that they should get a little art for the rooms, as the walls look somewhat bare. It is in Athens after all, so there’s no shortage of photos of ancient art and sites they could hang up. Also, the people at the front desk were all extremely helpful and seemed genuinely interested in how I was doing and how they could help, especially a nice fellow with a British accent. As for the location...well, here’s the thing. This is a couple of blocks away from the Archaeological museum, and is maybe 20-30 minutes walk from the main tourist area. I had no problems walking there at all. I saw families, and didn’t feel unsafe. But if you’re from the US and this is your first trip out of the country, Athens can be rather intimidating. The urban planning is poor or nonexistent, meaning the majority of the buildings were cheaply constructed to satisfy a massive influx of people several decades ago. They’re now feeling the effects of time, and many look dilapidated. The infrastructure is crumbling, meaning you’re going to see dirty and broken sidewalks pretty much everywhere. It’s also noisy, and smells of exhaust. So yes, it was noisy outside the window of the hotel, but it didn’t bother me. I’m sure it’s going to be like that most anywhere in town. And the graffiti...oh, the graffiti. In the US, graffiti means “bad neighborhood.” In Athens, I think it’s just part of the culture, because it’s everywhere. Athens is not bad. Athens is not dangerous or unsafe. And in no way am I trying to say this hotel is in a bad area, because it isn’t. There’s a Radisson right next door, and even in the ritzy areas of town, you’re going to find really high-end shops on the ground floor of buildings that look quite run down. And if you don’t want to walk down to the Acropolis and shopping areas, there’s other ways of getting there. The metro stop is about five minutes away, although I found the metro to be very crowded, no matter the time of day. You can also hop in a cab very easily, and like everything in Athens, they’re cheap. I don’t think it every cost me more than five euros to get anywhere I wanted to go. Just know that unlike most people I encountered in Athens, many of the cab drivers barely speak English — and if you’re like me, your pronunciation of Greek is very poor. So, maybe be prepared when you get in with a picture on your phone of where you want to go, or just lean in the window first and see how good their English is, or if they can understand where you want to go. Anyway, that was probably more information than any of you wanted, but I felt the need to counteract some of the reviews I’ve read that state this hotel is in a bad area of town, because it isn’t. Like any big city, keep an eye out for your belongings — but I’d say you’re far more likely to get pickpocketed in the Plaka or Monastiraki Square areas than you would around the Areos Hotel. Long story short, I’d highly recommend this place. It’s a very nice hotel, and the staff is excellent. Athens is a city everyone should see, and this is a great place to hang your hat.

349,"I rated this hotel as excellent because it is true to how it is represented. This hotel is a gem. It is not in a super-touristy part of town (meaning the market bazaar-type places), but only 2 stops on the metro from Monistiraki Station where all of that is located; however, it is only a few blocks from the Archaeological Museum and a few other attractions. Harry, and the other hotel staff, were super-friendly and helpful with suggestions on places to eat, transportation, etc. The room, itself, was fabulous. Unlike other places, you get a separate card to put in the slot for you electricity so, while we were still conscientious, we were able to leave our air conditioning on low during the day to keep the room cool if we went out. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was AMAZING. The water pressure was great and the shower is HUGE. It has an overhead rainbath shower head, hand held and faucet option. The hot water is VERY hot, so be cautious. In the room, there is a blackout panel you can pull if you would like to sleep in. There is also a small kitchenette with a hot top, sink and mini-fridge. I will caution, if you are not used to street noise or are bothered by it, you may wish to request the quietest room available. We were in 203, which faced a fairly busy street.Also, if room-service is big to you, the food items available are limited. We stayed the last two nights of our trip here and were not disappointed. We got some really good sleep and headed to the airport refreshed. I did not add photos as the ones already on Tripadvisor and on Google are accurate.

Bedroom is comfortable, very bright and has glass windows-doors on both sides. There are also a large terrace and even additional balcony from bedroom which we did not use due to some chilly weather in April. But we enjoyed our inside seating area with a view while having afternoon tea with sweets from local bakeries. Long corridor leads to a spacious bathroom. Honestly, I think that the spa-bath design is too unnecessary fancy and I did not figure out how to use it except as a shower. It was slightly uncomfortable for me to get it and out because of very high bath tub and narrow glass door access. Nevertheless, shower head was wonderful and water pressure was excellent. Needless to say all was very clean.Hotel personal is young, friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was good. WiFi worked well. We were not disturbed by street noise to notice it or to comment about it. We found hotel location as totally safe. Walk to metro station was easy and short; and one time we walked down to Monastiraki without transportation. Archaeological museum is really close to the hotel; and it turned a bonus for us as we went to this museum twice during our short stay.

355,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Areos Hotel in late May, we honestly did not know what to expect as we knew this wasn't a chain but it fit our budget well. We were so pleasantly surprised by the service, from start to finish. The staff was incredibly accommodating. Our first room was ok, a little outdated but we did love the fact that slippers were included, A/C and location was essential. We realized we would not be staying in the hotel the entire time as the city of Athens awaited us so we weren't hung up on it. The location was KEY. It is literally in the heart of everything. We walked to all places and never felt scared or uncomfortable. The Victoria metro station was about 5-10 minute walk away which was exactly what we needed to get around everywhere. As we traveled to different islands and would be coming back to stay at Areos hotel, the concierge held our large pieces of luggage until our return, which was CRUCIAL for us. Here is the real gem of the hotel: The front desk concierge Harris, he is an essential asset to the hotel. His recommendations for food, places to visit, bakeries to stop by, were key in making our stay comfortable and efficient. Being from NYC, we're particular about our food choices, but his recommendations were spot on!Harris took great care of us and when we returned he kindly upgraded our room and after a long few days of traveling, it was truly a blessing in disguise. This was EXCEPTIONAL customer service. My boyfriend and I were so grateful for his help, we stopped by a famous bakery shop and got him some goodies to show our appreciation for his kindness.Yes this place is not The Plaza, it is much better. Hospitality was wonderful, the breakfast was delicious, and Harris was a great example of above and beyond customer service.

356,"On my 2 week tour of Greece this is where we started and eventually ended our journey. One thing about Athens I learned is that it looks like a slum, full of graffiti and posters, flyers. This is a non-chain hotel and doesn't look like much from the outside but inside it is great. Incredible front desk staff either at 2pm or at 4am. I think is about 6 floors, if you don't count the '0' floor most European buildings use. Directly across the street from the Metro rail system and just a short four blocks from the National Archeology Museum. Very first rate rooms with all you would expect. Complimentary breakfast which runs longer than posted hours and you can have lunch or dinner as well. The front desk staff can give you simple directions to wherever you want to go. I had forgotten to bring my small 'day-pack' and they told me where to go to find some local shops, where I did find what I was looking for. The best aspect was when I had a bottle of Limon cello I wanted to share shots with the members of out group. I wasn't sure about bring your own drinks to a hotel bar, but the bartender had no problem putting my bottle into their freezer (it need to be ice cold) and even supplied us all and poured it into the 15 shot glasses at no charge or questions. We let him have one too. As I said the rooms are fairly standard for most hotels, but the service, advice, and hospitality put them over the top.

362,"We stayed 3 nights. Although expensive, but all of the hotels were, it is in an excellent location near the Plaka area, and so close to the Acropolis. The room top bar had been refurbished recently and was amazing. The views over the Acropolis and Athens were stunning. It looked a little run down outside in the street with lots of graffiti, but we found this all over Athens, and this location was one of the better ones. The reception was good and all staff were friendly. Rooms were small but very clean and beds were large and comfortable. The bathroom was tiny, shower wasn’t brilliant with a dated shower curtain, and the shower gel/shampoo etc was cheap. The breakfast was included and had so much choice and was very fresh and tasty, served in a lovely breakfast room. All in all a good choice. Close to Syntagma metro for the 40 minute trip to the Airport.","June 23, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

363,15 minute walk to the Acropolis and lovely view from the rooftop restaurant/bar so well worth having dinner here in the evening - need to reserve a table . Staff - as you expect in Greece - are very friendly and helpful. The room was very tight and the 2x3 metre mirror opposite the bed - which presumably is to give a sense of depth - is just weird... could create the same effect without going full length. Air con is centrally controlled so very warm in the morning. Still good option for a short stay in Athens right in the heart of the Plaka,"June 23, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

We mentioned it on the 2nd day of our stay, when we returned late we realized that nothing had been done. We were too tired to change rooms. Opening the window was not an option as we were above some exhaust from a kitchen and the room would stink. Had we been comfortable at night I would have no complaint.

373,"Right, here it goes. Very unsure with how to rate this hotel whether to put it down as a 3 or 4 stars, so I’ve opted for 4 stars.We turned up to the hotel and the outside it’s opposite a busy food market which is lovely, a nicer sight to see every morning. But the location of the hotel is excellent, a 15-20 minute walk from the acropolis and Plaka and a 5 minute walk from Monastiraki. But the area where it’s located is where all the immigrants live. I’m far from a snob but it’s dirty, dark and full of men leering around, it made me and my family very uneasy walking back here at night, so keep an eye on your pockets.The lobby is nothing spectacular but sometimes simple is better, we went to check in and the man was rather rude behind reception as he didn’t understand much English, but we spoke to a younger lady and she spoke good English and was more friendly. The lifts are tiny, there’s only two of them and could only fit two people in with suitcases and even that’s a tight squeeze.The rooms are very clean, rather modern and spacious. I love that they had air corn and provided toiletries (soap, shampoo, shower gel). The downside to the rooms was that when we book a double room, we expect a double bed and not two single beds pushed together. They have a roof top terrace with tables and chairs, sun beds and a bar. We a splendid view. The view of the acropolis is amazing and you also have a beautiful view of the rest of the city. It’s also open until late (midnight).The breakfast was ample, nothing amazing but it had everything you needed to fill your stomach for a long day ahead of you. A mix between hot food and continental and coffee and juice. The tables are very limited so if you have breakfast try and go as early or as late as you can to ensure you have a space.Overall, the hotel was quite nice. So it’s lovely hotel with clean rooms, a good breakfast and perfect location. It’s worth the money.","May 27, 2019","3    Central Athens Hotel

374,"In a quiet location in the centre of old Athens within a 10 minute walk of the acropolis and two metro stations. We had a view of the Acropolis from our window on the fifth floor and the terrace bar upstairs has a great view as well, although they weren’t particularly welcoming when we went to look when we first arrived. It’s a shame they don’t offer guests a complimentary glass of wine up there to encourage patronage. Instead there is complimentary liqueur in the small clean rooms with good mattresses and hot shower. Reception staff were efficient but not overly friendly. Breakfast was on the lower floor in a big well decorated modern restaurant area, however the food was average. If I could have given 3 1/2 I would have but it’s definitely not s 4 in my opinion.

385,"Was on a short holiday to Athens and stayed here as a central base so could seem the most of the city. It is an excellent location- in walking distance to the Acropolis, main shoping and tourist area an the the main square of the city and metro station . We have a fantastic night view of the Acropolis from the rooftop bar open I think until 11pm. One can take a taxi from the airport at Euro 55 but it is easier to take the very efficient and new metro (euro 10) and a short 7 min walk. from Syntagma Square. There are also buses but it also depends on time of travel . The hotel rooms are very spacious but my room faced inside and saw only some pipes . The room has a good bath , internet and a comfortable bed. The sofa was a bit sunk in possibly by overuse but ok. A nice work table and spacious. The elevator/ lift is VERY small and can accomodate only 3 persons at a time . This is the only negative I saw in the hotel - as it is frequently busty and you need to wait unless yo prefer to climb up by the stairs. Breakfast is on the mezzanine floor and a good spread of hot and cold stuff including eggs to order. But with such lovely variety of greek food as options - you may also want to walk around the area in Plaka and find nice bakeries and small shops if you want explore. I walked through the area right upto to the Acropolis a pleasant 20 minute walk (with a climb) and saw the Acropolis museum ( sunday free) and the Acropolis the high point of my visit. Reception at the Hotel is helpful and directs well on places to see.

Breakfast staff efficient but, again, cool. Breakfast spread quite abundant, and breakfast space rather pleasant. It was cold and rainy during our stay, so we did not visit the rooftop, unfortunately. This is a pretty big hotel, and the elevator is woefully inadequate (holds two small people, without luggage, at a time). It is clear that guests were smoking in their rooms (despite ""no smoking"" signs) without consequence. But here's the biggie: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PUT A REAL DOOR ON THE BATHROOM. There is a sort of swinging, non-latching foggy-glass partition that doesn't even go all the way to the floor. Fine if you're with someone you've been married to for 30 years, but even then, perhaps a little too intimate, if you catch my drift.

Train station is a 5 minute walk away. The location was very good with many restaurants, shops and sites all within an easy walking distance. The staff were very courteous and friendly, we had asked for a room facing the Acropolis and that is what we got. The view of course was fantastic because of this. We also got to hotel early and they allowed us to check-in with no problems. We booked a Superior double room and it was a fair size, clean and bright with lots of mirrors to make it appear bigger than it was. The bathroom was small but clean and the shower had plenty of hot water. The room was very quiet, no noise issues at all. The only complaint was the elevator, it was the smallest that we’ve seen in our travels, I’m a little claustrophobic so I took the stairs.We had an early flight to Santorini so we didn’t experience the breakfast. We informed the front desk about this the night before and they were kind enough to pack a breakfast for us to go , much appreciated. We tried booking the hotel on the way back but unfortunately there were no rooms available. We stayed at another nearby hotel and it wasn’t anywhere close to what we had experienced at the Central.

396,"This was an excellent choice for my family. The check-in was quick and the staff so kind.We had 3 rooms. They were not fancy but did the job. Very clean and beds were great. Bathroom was fine. The best part of this hotel is the LOCATION. It is ""Central"" to walk to almost anything you want to see. You must go to the rooftop. This hotel is very close to the Acropolis. It's a beautiful view during the day but at night, simply astonishing. The rooftop offers food and drinks and was very very good. The staff was excellent. My dream has always been to see Athens and my dream came true. I would stay here again. They offered a free breakfast buffet which was good. Since we left so early in the morning, the provided each of us with a sack lunch when we checked out. What a surprise.

The room had a small balcony ledge where we could open the double doors and have a beautiful view of the Acropolis. The room was very modern and immaculate. The bathroom was small but functional. The only think I didn't love was the bathroom door was a more like a folding closet door lacking a bit of a privacy.The Central Athens is within walking distance to EVERYTHING: Acropolis, Plaka, Monistraki, Syntagma, Thissio, shopping, restaurants.

399,"The hotel name says it all: a centrally located hotel in the Plaka district of Athens. Three other couples and ourselves stayed for three days and all agreed it met our travel needs. We could walk to most any place we wanted to see.This is important because traffic in Athens is heavy and the streets are narrow and not well marked. The rooms were small and clean with comfortable beds.The hotel staff was helpful and were ready to answer our questions The daily breakfast was generous and had Greek and American choices. The views from the roof top bar looked great but because of high winds and rain, we were not able to spend much time there .I recommend this great hotel for its location, breakfast and comfort.","October 8, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

First off, our room was ready early which was such a nice treat after being on a flight for 10 hours. We were also very surprised to find that our room had a view of the Acropolis which we were definitely not expecting. The location is perfect for exploring the major sites in Athens by foot with lots of restaurants and shops close-by. The rooftop bar is a definite must, we watched the sunset while enjoying drinks here and it was just wonderful. One thing to note is that there is only one elevator and it is very small so we usually took the stairs to avoid waiting forever. Aside from that, I would definitely recommend this hotel!","October 3, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

401,"We didn't stay here on our recent visit*, but the rooftop bar is always where we start our evenings. We've always been lucky to get a table with an amazing view, but try to arrive before the sunset to pick your spot. Order an appetizer and a glass of wine, then watch the Acropolis magically light up in slow motion as the twilight fades. You're high above the noise of the city with box seats for the dramatic light show. *We stayed in the hotel several years ago and I remember the rooms being very tidy and efficient with a wonderful breakfast.","September 30, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

The hotel is centrally located in the heart of Plaka and in walking distance to the Acropolis. The rooms are remodeled and are very clean and comfortable though a bit too small. This was not an issue for us as we only stayed here for one night. We had to leave at 6AM so we did not get to try the hotel's breakfast but the receptionists were so nice and had the kitchen employees pack for us sandwiches, pastries, and juices. We LOVED the rooftop bar. The view of the acropolis from the rooftop is lovely and it was very convenient to relax at the bar before walking to dinner. There are hundreds of cool restaurants and bars just around the hotel. We found the receptionists attitude and service to be superb.

The positive points are the rooftop bar with a lovely view of the Acropolis, clean room, the nice breakfast & most of the staff. The negatives were the gentleman behind the front desk when we checked in. I don’t know his name but he was very unfriendly and when we asked questions, he gave the impression we were bothering him. We checked in around lunchtime on a Tuesday. Also, the elevator is, well, ridiculously small. Hopefully no one ever gets stuck in that elevator! The room was quite small and the beds were very hard. Glad we were only there for one night. The location is good but didn’t feel like we were in a very nice area of Athens.","September 22, 2018","3    Central Athens Hotel

407,"The week previous, we had paid more to stay at the awful Athens Cypria hotel a few streets away- please read my review. We then went off to the islands and came back to Athens Central for one night and we were very happy with this hotel. They kindly minded our luggage while we were gone for free. (We just took little backpacks to the islands).Central was clean and although our room was small, it was very adequate for our needs. We were on the 1st floor so could walk up the stairs (elevator very, very slow). Our room had a balcony, which was its saving grace as it made the small room seem a bit more spacious when the doors were open. It was nice to sit on the balcony and watch Athens wake up in the morning. Internet in room was slow.Rooftop bar had a lovely view of the Pantheon. There is also an unheated jacuzzi which I imagine would be nice to come back to in the hot summer months.Breakfast was plentiful and suited us fine.The location is fabulous. We walked from the train station easily. Close by for shopping, eating and drinking. We happened upon some very cool bars in courtyards close to the hotel.Staff were welcoming and efficient.

We found it to be centrally located to the Plaka which is nice considering this is where all the shopping and restaurants are located. Short walking distance to most major sightseeing or bus tours. The views from the hotel room leave some to be desired while the rooftop patio is great for sunsets and views of the Acropolis during the day or night.

422,"This hotel is in a very good spot. It is just down from the Acropolis museum. The hotel is an area full of decent restaurants and fast casual places. Geared for tourists, so not five star dining of course. The Acropolis is just up the hill, an easy walk, and the Athens gardens and Temple of Zeus are down the hill. All worth seeing. The Temple of Hephaestus is about a 15-20 minnute walk through all the tourist shops, restaurants and gelaterias. The temple is in a paid park, but worth the cost (8 euro?) as it is the most preserved of all Greek Temples. The Parliament is also a 15 minute walk but NOT a must see. It is connected to the main shopping street, which is good if that’s what you want. The hotel is relatively new (2 years?) and is a nice boutique. The rooms are perfect - small but normal by European standards. The bathroom is nice and modern. One of the nicest features, beyond it being new and the location, is the rooftop bar and breakfast.

431,"This hotel was booked after reading the TripAdvisor reviews. It’s in a great location- within walking distance to acropolis & other neighborhoods such as Plaka, if you like longer walks. One piece of information which wasn’t easily available online is that the hotel does NOT have parking. If you have a car, then it better be tiny (ex. Smart car) because street parking will be challenging. The hotel is modern. They keep the entry door locked & the front desk person lets you in. Like most European elevators, there’s is tiny. The room we were in was spacious. Bathroom was nice, especially the shower with spa panel. The drainage inside the shower wasn’t the best. Bed & pillows were comfortable. Refrigerator and safe come in handy. Breakfast was impressive for a boutique hotel. Very nice selection with a view of acropolis from the dining area. Anna was there to greet us each morning. Overall, I’d recommend this hotel.","January 7, 2019","7    AD Athens Luxury Rooms and Suites

432,"We stayed at AD Athens last week and were happy with the stay and the rooms. We had two rooms and both were relatively large rooms. The hotel is located right next to the Acropolis Museum and within a 2-3 minute walk from all the tourist attractions. The neighborhood is safe and very vibrant. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They arranged airport transfers for us with a taxi driver who was knowledgeable and equally friendly.One suggestion I have is if they could add a sliding door to the shower. The shower is quite fancy but the enclosure is pretty small and without a door. So, the water tends to splash out easily. This didn't cause much discomfort for us but something for the owners to think about.","January 3, 2019","7    AD Athens Luxury Rooms and Suites

433,"Having stayed in Athens several times, i had quite a precise idea about what hotel I would like, and accidentally stumbled upon this little gem, which had it all.It has the most perfect location near the main walking street that windles around several historic sites and is close to the Plaka and other lovely streets with a magical atmosphere to hang out in. Metro is practically on the doorstep as well. Also, the hotel and its room are beyond stylish. In spite of the area the hotel is quiet and offers great sleep and relaxation not even mentioning the wonderful breakfast on the rooftop terrace overlooking - what else - the Acropolis. Rooms are clean, and staff is just amazing. Friendly, professional, and with a great knoweldge not only of Athens, but somehow also of what to recommend you personally.","December 2, 2018","7    AD Athens Luxury Rooms and Suites

Just one min walk to many recommended restaurants on tripadvisor below the hotel, two min walk to the Acropolis museum and three min walk to the Acropolis. Five min walk to Plaka.Despite being in such a bustling place, the hotel is located on a quiet side street, with views of the Acropolis from the hotel’s bar. You can’t beat that! Attentive and friendly hotel staff. Thank you for packing breakfast for us as we had to catch a very early flight. The free upgrade and bottles of wine was a pleasant surprise for us. Room was clean, bathroom was spacious and good toiletries. The breakfast selection is small which consists of mainly cold food like yogurt, fruits, cold cuts and toasts. Hot and cold drinks are self service. Though it doesn’t boast hot breakfast buffet like many hotels, it is good enough.

The only negatives- the smoke alarm kept going off due to someone smoking in their room.

441,"Stayed here one night. Super clean room, nice toiletries offered and good shower. The patio where breakfast is served was really nice and came with a spectacular view from the rooftop- also serves as a nice place for a late night drink as it doubles as the bar at nighttime. Staff on arrival and departure were SUPER helpful, which is why I give this place 5 stars. We went to dinner not far from the hotel in the Plaka area- highly recommend this area. This hotel is super walkable to anything you could need. We took taxis to and from the airport, which was the flat rate of 38 Euros (an Athens rule). The drivers will try to up the price when you go to the airport from the city centrer, so be sure to confirm the price before you get in the taxi! For all travelers to Greece, be aware, Greece has unique plumbing and does not allow you to flush toilet paper. Yup, do not flush any toilet paper or else you may back up the plumbing system. This is Greece wide and really not a big deal (same goes for places in Africa) but just be ready for it :) We visited a few Greek islands and it is the same there too.

We had previously stayed at a different hotel down the street but wanted to try something new and we were so glad we did! First of all the hotel is so close to the Acropolis station that we kept walking around in circles because it was just that close that it just wasn't believable LOL We arrived 2 hours earlier than check in & it was so great that they could already provide us with a room since we just wanted to rest before starting our adventure in Athens again. The staff is just amazing at this hotel always willing to help & give recommendations!OMG one of the best things about this place is the rooftop terrace/bar!!!

448,When making our two room reservation back in March two of the main reasons we chose this hotel was the location and the photos of the rooms with a view of the acropolis. When checking in we where told the hotel only had one room with a view and it was taken ☹️. Never any where on hotels.com did it say one room with view. There is a view of the acropolis on the rooftop patio but not the same as a room view. The location is close to the acropolis walking distance and the subway station that was a perk. It does get noisy at night with people walking around and cars since it’s in a busy area.

Not only did they have gluten-free bread for her to enjoy at breakfast, they also had many other gluten-free products for her, including cookies. The entire breakfast buffet for guests was delicious and contained several Greek specialities. The rooms were beautiful, and the view at breakfast was amazing as there is a fantastic view of the Acropolis. Make sure to see the view in the evening, also. The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and modern-looking. I appreciated the safe in the room, as well as the elevator. Our room did have small steps inside so be careful when you enter (see photo). The location of the hotel was great for visiting sites and there is also a grocery store nearby. I am so glad we stayed at this hotel. The staff was amazing (even letting us enjoy breakfast and check-in very early as we arrived via an overnight ferry from Crete). It is my understanding that the hotel is only a year old. It was remodeled into a hotel from a building next to the new Acropolis museum. I highly recommend this hotel when visiting Athens. This hotel’s staff will make you feel very welcome and comfortable.

Breakfast spread was limited, but good. The rooftop has great views of the Acropolis! What makes this hotel a gem -- the location and its staff.

The front desk personnel were friendly, helpful and kind enough to offer us an upgrade to a more spacious room. The breakfast is served at the rooftop cafe, which has an incredible view of Acropolis, but the service is rather indifferent, or I might say it was completely absent. My only objection is for the type of breakfast offered. As a Greek I can assure you that some of the items served do not belong to the Greek breakfast menu, e.g. I don't know many greeks that eat ""dolmadakia"" (stuffed wine leaves), ""siglino"", ""strapatsada"" or ""siropiasta sweets"" for breakfast. ""Feta"" is indeed a typical Greek type of cheese, but it is not the most appropriate cheese for breakfast and also orange juice is not a tasteless yellow-colored sweet liquid.","December 5, 2017","7    AD Athens Luxury Rooms and Suites

The shower is amazing and the hot water was never ending.Breakfast was also really good- there were stuffed grape leaves, spinach and feta pie, boiled eggs, bread, ham and cheese, honey,jam, butter, and granola for the delicious yogurt (you know, Greek yogurt - except better than US grocery brands and just called yogurt here!). Perhaps one of the nicest elements of breakfast is that you can have it in open air or the roof with a killer view of the Acropolis!Two doors down in one direction is a small grocery to get drinks and snacks and other essentials as needed, and across the street is a souvlaki place that is open late. This hotel also offered great value for cost and I would stay here again another time. I didn't see any of the other hotels that I had considered before booking and arriving and have hotel envy. I was fully pleased with my experience here!","November 23, 2017","7    AD Athens Luxury Rooms and Suites

466,Very recently opened new hotel right next to the Acropolis and Plaka. Simple and modern welcoming reception with Angelo greeting you with a smile and plenty of information. An exclusive view of the Acropolis from the roof top where a delicious Greek breakfast is served and great for a relaxing drink before going to bed for the night. Good sized modern room very nicely set and comfortable. Although room was clean it was obvious that it was hurriedly made up at the last moment and it looked like the floor was only partly washed up at the room entrance which was still wet.,"November 8, 2017","7    AD Athens Luxury Rooms and Suites

467,"We stayed for three nights before flying to Santorini. This was the cheapest of three hotels on this trip, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the accommodation and service.The room: we had a two room on the first floor, it had clearly been recently renovated and he decor and fittings were all of a high standard.Staff: All he staff were helpful and friendly, with special mention going to Angel on the front desk, who was a wealth of information and always welcomed us with a huge smile! He sorted our airport transfer and breakfast boxes upon leaving for our early morning flight. He’s real asset to the hotel.The location: Fantastic. Very close to he major tourist spots and only a 2 min walk from the Acropolis Museum, which I’d recommend visiting before visiting the Acropolis (an Angel tip!). There’s a variety of nice restaurants nearby and a wine bar on the corner.I’m not one for staying in the same place twice, however if I do visit Athens in future I wouldn’t hesitate to book here again.","October 12, 2017","7    AD Athens Luxury Rooms and Suites

469,"We were a bit uncertain when we were dropped off in the neighborhood down the street, but that quickly dissipated when we found the hotel. Modern, sleek, beautiful glass doors, a welcoming lobby area and super friendly staff. They gave us a brief tour, brought our bags up, and went through our double room's amenities and perks of the hotel. We thanked her, and explored Athens. When we got back however, the cracks in the facade began to show.Pros first: Breakfast is always included, and while not spectacular, it has great service, a good selection of food. Please note, there's no A/C in the lobby (but there is in your room), so it can feel a little stuffy. The bathroom was incredible, beautiful tile work, an open shower area with rain shower, and LED lighted mirror. Most importantly, the neighborhood is incredible, with top restaurants, bars, nightlife and more. The walk to the Acropolis is a bit far (15-20 minutes to the tour area entrances) but besides that we never felt the need to leave the neighborhood.Now the sadder stuff:The reading lights next to the bed? Holding on by (literally) a wire, and were unusable. The TV, which requires two remotes to function, was frustrating. Neither remote worked, we were able to to physically turn the TV on, but the satellite didn't work, the box didn't work, and the TV was a failure. These things can could be ignored, but the most egregious fault can't.The WiFi in room is absolutely terrible, and I don't mean wow this is slow terrible, I mean it just doesn't work. We would have to stand by the door to even try connecting, and forget about using it while on the bed. In 2019, for a hotel ranked in the top 10 on TripAdvisor, this is absolutely unforgivable. There is WiFi in the lobby as I mentioned, Overall, it's a fine hotel, but it is not a top 10 hotel. 3 stars for the friendly service, location, and presentation, but certainly not close to a 5.","July 8, 2019","8    O&B Athens Boutique Hotel

We did not get a good view from our window but that was not a big deal. While the area looks busy, it was quiet at night in our rooms. Even when we arrived late at night, we felt safe.

Breakfast was wonderful and so was all the staff. My only gripe would be we missed our 1st night due to our flight getting rescheduled and we still were charged for the room that night(although we were comped at the restaurant).

We were warmly welcomed and treated to a tasty treat with shots of a clear alcohol - not ouzo. The neighboring buildings were run down. If you faced the Parthenon, all was cool. Lots of antique sellers spilling on to the streets. We walked to the acropolis, marketplaces and restaurants. No problem except some crowded sidewalks. Maria served us discounted drinks at the cool bar and we had a great conversation with her about Greece and the Greek education system. Wonderful breakfast with lots of choices.

Much easier and not much difference in terms of price compare to getting a taxi outside. Our room was clean, simple, street view, just what we needed. Breakfast was good. Service was fantastic. We needed to checkout in early morning to catch the early flight to Santorini. Hotel staff offered us a well-packed take away box with juice, water, bread, sandwiches, apples and some cookies.

We were greeted promptly and taken to our clean room with wonderful views -- it was worth the extra money to pay for the Acropolis Petite Suite. The balcony is amazingly large -- you could host 20 people on it comfortably (no joke -- maybe have your wedding here?). The daily breakfast buffet is nice, not amazing, but does the trick. The whole hotel is well maintained, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

We arrived at the hotel from the airport by taxi and were greeted by a very friendly receptionist who took time to show us the hotel location in relation to all the main attractions before personally showing us to our room. The room was located on the 2nd floor and very pleasant with a very large bathroom. Shortly after we had settled in our room we were brought some snacks and a glass of Greek liquer. The food at breakfast was very good and the staff all very friendly and attentive. We had one evening meal in the restuarant on a wet evening and that also was very pleasant.It was a very pleasant stay and the staff couldn’t have been more accommodating arranging a hire car for us and providing details of local trips. They printed our boarding cards and stored both ours and our sons luggage.The surrounding area is very quirky being located in the midst of the flea market but this was not dissimilar to other areas of Athens and the local area Pisiri is a very lively area with plenty of bars and restaurants.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at O&B and couldn’t fault the accommodation and the service and would recommend this hotel for a short stay or an extended stay in Athens.,"April 28, 2019","8    O&B Athens Boutique Hotel

The room was typical European city hotel size (ok for 2persons for 3 nights with only hand baggage). Bathroom had a ’high end design’ style but lacked a bit of functionality. Still, everything worked well and the room and the hotel was clean. WiFi (free) worked fine. The reception staff was very kind in helping us with some connection issues. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. From the first second on we felt very welcome in the hotel. The location is at Psiri, on a side street of Ermou Street that runs from Monastiraki Square. The metro from airport (Blue line) stops at Monastiraki station and you have about 500m-700m walk along Ermou street to the hotel. The neighbourhood might seem ’rough’ with graffiti,etc. and its not the tidiest of streets. However, we did not have or see anything that would have made us feel anyway unsafe.

502,"Another stellar review - I tend to review the places or experiences that were meaningful or exceptional to help my fellow travelers as opposed to reviewing everything.The O&B Hotel was chosen based on location and great reviews; also we're moving away from rentals after re-embracing the boutique hotel experience in London last year. We love the freedom of rentals but when in a new city, having personalized and attentive service from hotel staff is priceless. The O&B Hotel was no exception.We arrived early on a Saturday, stayed three nights, and had three full days in Athens after sailing around the islands for a week. We were still swaying slightly from the boat! The front desk staff was so friendly and accommodating, helping us with our plans for the city and making us comfortable immediately, it was such a gentle re-entry to land and an exciting launch to our stay in Athens. We couldn't wait to go explore... but he insisted on showing us our room first, despite the early hour the room was ready. We had booked a room with a balcony and view of the Acropolis, but he gave us what I think was the second best room - we not only had a view from everywhere in the room but also the generous sized balcony... beautiful! Efcharisto!We also very much appreciated the guidance and help from a detailed plan for our 3 days of exploring - restaurants, places to wander, music, museums, food, gardens, neighbourhoods, everything we wanted to do in this fun city. Just enough, not too much. You probably noticed I didn't rave about all the details of our room, the wonderful breakfast and amenities - they were all excellent. We choose boutique hotels like the O&B for the experience, the staff, surrounding ourselves with a small hotel experience we feel gives us the best people to help us enjoy our travels. They more than delivered and we will return again.","November 17, 2018","8    O&B Athens Boutique Hotel

504,"We reserved a room for 4. The room was spacious enough for the 4 of us compared to other reviews I read on tripadvisor on other hotels. There was a king size bed and two twin beds side by side. The entrance was a bit cramped on entry to the room, but then again, we didn't spend much time in the room other than sleep. The room was very clean and modern including the bathroom. We received a nice welcome plate of bruschetta? olives and cucumbers along with a drink(shot?) to our room. Beds were comfy enough. We were all tired from the tourist day that we all slept well anyway. The location was perfect. The hotel was located on a side street but great location. My sister and I are in our late 40's, early 50's and we were able to walk to many sites. The hotel staff routed a walking tour for us and were able to walk to the Acropolis, Hadrian's arch, Zeus temple, Panathenaic stadium, walk through the national garden onto the changing of guard at Parliament, Syntagma Square,Athens cathedral, Plaka then back towards Monastiraki all in one day. We did run out of time to get to Ancient Agora. We opted to read through most of the site markers instead of tour guides which helped us get through all these sites in one day. The hotel is few blocks to Monastiraki. The hotel attendant says the hotel is actually located in Psiri. All the hotel staff were so friendly and helpful. There was enough of a breakfast selection both hot and cold food items. The staff even packed a small snack bag for us as we had an early flight on our departure date. There were plenty of nearby restaurants to choose from all within walking distance. It was a great stay and I would stay here again.","November 12, 2018","8    O&B Athens Boutique Hotel

507,"Word of mouth and good reviews are what this boutique hotel depends upon for referrals. just think I was thinking about staying at my usual default - the Hilton. But if you have a short stay in Athens, and do not want to hike a few miles each time you tour the sites, staying close to the action makes sense. The title of this review says it all. Five stars says it all but i'll give a pass to the room which was a little small, with little room for your luggage, no dresser to store things, but otherwise pleasant and comfortable especially the bed.

Such a warm and welcoming hotel, with super friendly staff. Very clean and modern. An oasis in a busy, crowded, hot city. Great location, although the side street is rather drab and the building across the street looks like it has seen better days. But a quiet safe street, not far from the ""action."" Room was quiet, and on our last night we had a view of the Acropolis from our deck. AC worked well, cheerful and comfortable room.Breakfast was FANTASTIC in their street level dining room.

The area of the hotel has a lot of graffiti, which is actually part of the artistic vibe of the area. The graffiti doesn’t mean it’s a bad area, but rather it’s actually a very good place! We were walking around the area at night around 2 am and felt safe walking together. The room was very comfortable. Like many major cities, hotel rooms are not going to be super spacious, but there was enough room for us to feel comfortable. The bathroom was very spacious and modern. We stayed in their regular room.The only downside to our stay was that the WiFi was barely working properly. It said we were connected, but it was very slow or it just wouldn’t work.

527,"Am I missing something? This hotel apparently has 8.7 on hotels.com and a 5 star rating!This is what I experienced:1st. Promised parking in their garage, which was the reason I chose the hotel and was important to me when booking as parking in Athens is quite difficult. No parking available when I arrived. No help in finding parking!*The room: straight back to Las Vegas in the 90s! A smell of old smoke or mold or just uncleaned floor to floor carpet that is nauseating and sticks to everything you dare to take out of your bag.Old dark and outdated rooms... not a problem if it was a 3 star hotel maybe. But for 200 EUR/night! Bath was ok.*General impression of half unmotivated staff and old hotel is just really not what you expect for that price.To finish of positively. The location is nice, and the pool on the roof which isn’t bigger than a larger jacuzzi is ok I guess. Never will I stay here again though.

To the centre it´s just about 20 minutes by walking but there is also a train right around the corner of the hotel.- we had an late check out til 2pm, but right at 12am the cleaner cames into the room, even we still had the DND at the door. We told them that reception said we can check out later. The cleaner was telling us we are the last room he has to clean and that it is better for him if we could go right away. That´s absolutely a NO GO. The other minus was the bar staff in the evening. We where going to the bar area and take a seat and nobody came to bring us the menu or take the order. We had to go to the bar directly to get the menu and also again to place our order. Not the kind of service a for star hotel should serve.All in all it is a nice hotel, we felt very well.Jut the staff of housekeeping and bar need little more training.If we ever come back to Athen we will book again with Crowne Plaza.","May 22, 2019","9    Crowne Plaza Hotel - Athens City Centre

539,"This hotel is located fairly close to the historic centre of Athens, with a Metro station nearby. I stayed here from 3 to 8 January 2019. It is always good to arrive after a very long flight but before the official check-in time and hear: “We got your email and your room is ready for you.” Not just that but: “you’ve been upgraded.” The welcome fruit basket and the biscuits and chocolate were just what I needed. The welcome drink and snack would have been even more welcome if the Bar (and Reception) had been staffed when I first tried to use the voucher; no problem the second time.In most such hotels, the General Manager is just a signature at the bottom of the welcome letter, but in my room were his full contact details – excellent!Comfort was what I paid for and got: Crowne Plaza hotels deserve their reputation. The staff were invariably courteous and attentive. The man who escorted me to my room was very helpful in explaining how to use the key card and the air conditioning.My room 612 (photo) was spacious and well equipped: a bed so comfortable that it could have contained a family; a generously sized desk; numerous power points. The indications on the switches for DO NOT DISTURB/LAUNDRY/MAKE UP THE ROOM (photo) were particularly clear – a pleasant change from many hotels. There were as usual almost no clear indications of what the light switches controlled; in two cases, I eventually discovered the dimmer switches, one hidden on the floor behind the bedside table. Nightlights may have been there, but I did not find them. Above the bed there was a fire alarm ceiling light. Its constant flashing did nothing to improve my sleep quality. In many other hotels, the fire alarm was located out of eye contact of the sleeping guest. When I reported that the reading lamp (photo) was flickering, it was fixed on the same day.The WiFi was easy to access, with a strong signal, but – although I invariably clicked on “Connect automatically” - I had to log on with the password every I turned on my laptop and mobile, sometimes a slow and frustrating process (one photo – I have many more).A first for me was access to the room safe – with the credit card I used for the deposit and payment. I found this very convenient.The TV had a wide range of channels in several languages, with a lot of sport. The listing in the Guest Directory was pretty accurate. There was no Radio channel, as far as I could ascertain. There was a panoramic window with a view of the Attic Hills (photos). The storage space for luggage and clothes was more than adequate.The bathroom was big enough, with a bath/shower unit (photo) and a generous supply of toiletries, but not enough space around the basin for my own toiletries; there was no non-slip bath mat. The waste bin was a noisy pedal-operated one with a metal lid, the kind that make the guest’s life unnecessarily difficult in some hotels. The desk bin was open-topped.The cleaning staff were unobtrusive and thorough, even discreetly and helpfully tidying away the items I had left in the bathroom.The two bathrobes and pairs of slippers were an added bonus. The tea/coffee-making facilities were excellent, and there was even hot chocolate. The room’s design was fairly modern and tasteful. I tried the breakfast buffet on my last day: it was good but slightly smaller than could be expected from a hotel of this category. There was a refreshingly large proportion of local dishes, instead of the usual predominance of US breakfast items. There was a limited range of soft drinks, relieved by a mechanical juicer, providing fresh orange juice. The service was attentive but not obtrusive.","January 13, 2019","9    Crowne Plaza Hotel - Athens City Centre

The club lounge had snacks available all day including breakfast pastries, midday sandwiches / rolls plus meat and fish dishes in the evening. There was an extensive choice of both cold and hot food at the breakfast buffet in the restaurant on the ground floor.

543,"Great in every way except for the gym. My wife and I stayed in Athens for a long weekend. We stayed here using some IHG points. This is a great property with an excellent location just a five minute walk from a metro station that has a direct line to the airport. Total transit time to and from the airport is about forty minutes. It's just two or three stops from the Greek Parliament, the Parthenon, and all the big tourist attractions in Athens. It's also a short fifteen minute walk from the foot of Mount Lycabettus, the tallest mountain (or more accurately, hill) in Athens, which is a great walk if you enjoy that sort of thing.The only downside is that the gym is rather mediocre - the dumbbells only go up to about 7 kg, and there are no other free weights, no barbells, and limited machines. But beyond that, the rooms are great, with comfortable beds and a good, large bathroom. Great service - they let my wife check in early and check out after me. I was upgraded to a club room since it was the off season, and they also have a nice balcony view too.Also, one note for higher IHG rewards members - here, they let me choose between lounge access or 600 IHG points on check in, since I have Spire Elite status. I chose the lounge, which I would highly recommend. The lounge has some croissants and drinks in the morning, and also has a very large selection of a little over a dozen different liquors at night, all of decent quality (IE Johnny Walker, Smirnoff, etc.). Great if you're looking to have a cheap drink with a friend.Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a place to stay in Athens. I was just looking for a place to use my rewards points while staying in Athens, and this place fit the bill completely.","December 9, 2018","9    Crowne Plaza Hotel - Athens City Centre

544,"Overall the hotel is well maintained and the bed is extremely comfortable, with proper duvets and feather down pillows. Bathroom offers nice Greek toiletries, shaving mirror with its own light & a bidet as well.Some critical points worth mentioning are the ridiculous minibar prices (€12 for a single shot liquor bottle, €5 for a small soft drink bottle) which are too high for a mid-range hotel in Greece, and that housekeeping comes into the room in the morning even when the “do not disturb” light is on. As I checked in at 3:30 in the morning I really wanted to sleep untilcheck-out, but was woken up at 9:30. No apology was given from housekeeping or reception.Regular Crowne Plaza visitors staying in standard rooms will not find the usual CP amenities such as the room/pillow spray. When I asked the housekeeping lady she mentioned these are only available on the executive floors. As an IHG Gold member I was surprised I wasn’t on one of those floors or upgraded to any kind of preferred room such as high floor or view etc. Late check-out request was also denied, only allowed to check out 1pm instead of noon (previous hotel allowed 4pm without any status)Status customers will should not expect any preferred treatment at this property.

547,They still allow smoking in the hotel despite the law changes in 2010. The mix smoking and non-smoking rooms together. If you're going to flout the law then at least put all the smokers who want to kill themselves on the same floor and not kill those of us who want to live a smoke free life. Frankly most places in Athens openly flout the law. The repairs in the rooms need to be done to a much higher standard. It is very disappointing to see that you can't get a job finished to the same standard as the original finish. Repairing tiles and bath sealant is not a hard job and easy to get right ...and easy to get wrong. Cleaning around baths and sinks should be a priority and cleaning products used all the time. This would stop mould and dirt accumulating. Staff are friendly and efficient.baggage storage is in a room next to the front door and anyone can access this as I did when I came to collect my bag.

563,This hotel is not even close to worth what you pay and poorly trained rude staff make it terrible. Just up the road from the Hilton and the rate I paid was on average over euro200 a night. The room was small and smelly because it was dirty. I don’t think it was vacuumed while I was there and the carpets did not seem to be cleaned properly ever. The gym was awful - no towels or wipes provided and very limited poorly maintained equipment One mat not cleaned and the bike was broken - simply needed the chain repaired. On the Sunday I arrived I had to beg someone to look at it - finally did and sort of fixed it - broke again on the Monday - only when the manager arrived did anything actually happen or any complaints get addressed. The rest of the staff did nothing but basically lie and say they had tried to call me when they had not - even though I asked for email responses. They tried hard to get me to go somewhere far from reception to complain but the only way you get any action is if you complain at the tiny checkin desk where others are also waiting - otherwise the particularly rude weekend lady just talks on the phone while you wait. I booked an additional night to ensure an early check in - which was then chaos both at reception and breakfast - only sorted out the next day when the manager got involved. Breakfast is tour group style - nothing to order - eggs fried and left to lie there through out service. No working WiFi in breakfast area.

575,"We recently stayed here for a long weekend City break. The staff were so friendly and helpful, from when we checked in to helping us get orientated. There is a lovey roof top pool, with a bar a restaurant or the top floor. There are a few sun loungers if you want some down time in the sun. Our room was clean and very modern, and made up each day. It is in a good location for Taxis into the city - if your feeling lazy like us - about €7, but also close to a metro station. I would certainly stay here again if going back to Athens!

576,"We stayed a week at this hotel during July.If there was a 4.5 grade, then this is what I would give the hotel. The hotel is great on almost all aspects, other than the location, which reduces it attractiveness slightly.Location1: there is a free shuttle bus to the center; but it is rather infrequent (every hour or so, and stops running a little too early at night). The walk to the Metro station is rather unpleasant. It is not dangerous, but much of the walk is along a busy highway, without a proper pedestrian walkway. This means that you are stuck with the mercy of Taxis, and most of those don't have much mercy; we've taken at least 4 taxi rides each day (with some days more than 4) for a week, and 7 out of 10 rides would be fairly unpleasant or dishonest: overcharge, take the long way around, claim the ride is ""fixed price"", smoke in the car, etc. (Taxi drivers all over the world try to rip you off, if they can, but it seems that in Athens they try harder.)Location2: the location is not bad; with some patience, the Acropolis museum is only about 15-20 minute walk; it is just not a very pleasant walk. The city center (Syntagma square) is another 15 minute walk from the museum.Location3: The Koukaki neighborhood is across the highway (which means it is about 10 minute walk) is a really nice neighborhood, residential, and also small restaurants and bars. You can walk through this neighborhood up to the Philopappos hill and Monument, which makes a spectacular view of the city and of the whole Acropolis area.The hotel is rather new and very convenient. Everything works almost perfectly. The lifts are a little annoying, because the chip-based cards take a little too long to respond, and the door usually closes before you manage to press the floor button. Even after some practice, it still takes a while to press the button. This is done for security reasons, so it is fine, although a slightly faster, contactless, card, would have provided the same security, with a much simpler experience.The rooms are large and spacious, and the beds are huge and comfortable. The A/C works really well, quiet and effective. The shower/bathroom facilities are just great. The wi-fi also works well.In spite of being a high-ranking loyalty member, we got the room with the depressing view of a deserted building, which looks like it was specially imported from Chernobyl after the nuclear accident. The other side of the corridor has much nicer views, with some rooms even having a line of sight to the Acropolis.A number of airlines use this hotel for their pilots and flight attendants. Breakfast is great. There is a lady that prepares eggs who is probably a Master Chess player; there is hardly any queue; you walk up to her, tell her what sort of eggs you'd like, and go back to your seat; she remembers all the orders, and quickly figures out who belongs to whom in the dining room, and you would often hear her say something like ""you can bring this omelet to your brother"". She is spectacular and gives the best, most effective, service. The concierge services are wonderful. They are available 24-hours a day, and you can even contact them via e-mail. You can order a car-hire through them, and the car would be delivered to the hotel, and picked up from the hotel. You can book various trips through them. Or ask them for guidance and advice. Always helpful, always excellent service.The food and drinks in the lobby are unreasonably expensive, but I also have to say that they are very (very) good.Security: I spotted numerous security people in the hotel day and night. I'm not sure of the details, but it looked like security is taken very seriously. This is very reassuring.Another issue in the hotel, which I suspect is true for other hotels in Athens, and maybe the whole of Greece, is that the corridors are invariably filled with a smell of cigarette smoke. It seems that some of the guests smoke in the non-smoking rooms, and it doesn't look like smoking regulation is enforced. The rest of the staff, including _everyone_ (check-in counter, cleaning services, taxi porter) are all excellent and provide the best service.","July 13, 2019","10    InterContinental Athenaeum

Also, the room was newly renovated, super clean and very spacious. The breakfast was very good, especially the small but fluffy pancakes. Clio at customer service was very polite.Cons: the bathroom was very small and dated for a suite, and the room had a lumpy bed and kitsch miniature metal cars in EU countries flag colours on the wall. The ladies at the Club Reception on the 8th floor were not very polite, they looked bored and chatted loudly among themselves annoying the mostly foreign businessmen guests, especially Thetis.Overall, a great city centre hotel for businessmen, families and couples to stay in.

593,"It is difficult to add something new to all reviews of Athenaeum InterContinental. I stayed in this hotel for a week in December 2018 for a conference. My room was large, very comfortable and quiet. The professional services were very good; friendly but not overly pushy. Location: yes the hotel is located a bit far away from Syntagma Square. I walked to and from the hotel several times. Approximately 25 minutes one way. Yes, the path walks in Athens are terrible. I tripped several times. Be careful. Of course, this has nothing to do with the hotel. The shuttle bus goes to the Square every hour. Taxi costs approximately 10 euros. Food: if you do not feel like eating in the hotel, there is a very small caffe in front of the hotel, in addition to a family-run eatery approximately 200 m from the hotel to the right. These establishments will definitively help you to avoid going hungry to bed. A lot of restaurants 12-15 minutes walk from the hotel in the direction of downtown. As I mentioned, be careful when walking. Your best bet is to use an official crossing of the major car artery. In summary: this hotel represents the American standard in Athens. Slightly remote location from the city centre may bring some issues, however.","May 15, 2019","10    InterContinental Athenaeum

594,"This is my sixth year staying at the InterContinental Athenaeum, and the first that I was upgraded to the executive level. The 8th floor executive and service staff are all exceptional - they seemed to know what I needed practically before I knew myself. Given my intensive schedule providing one-on-one coaching services for the MIT Enterprise Forum of Greece accelerator each year, this kind of support and thoughtfulness is extremely helpful. My room was the same style as in previous years - lots of space, great bed, WiFi and Ethernet access, windows that open (a little bit, anyway), good shower. TV is OK though I hate that there is no Sleep option and it's a bit outdated in terms of access to movies and other features... but one does not come to Athens to watch TV! (I am just a terrible sleeper...)In addition to helping to make a challenging business trip more manageable, the views and service in the 8th floor ""club"" were wonderful (see photos). Food is great in the various restaurants. Unfortunately, it was too cold most days to use the balcony for breakfast but it's great to be able to step out even for a few moments to drink in the view. The location is a bit inconvenient relative to where I work but as the waterfront continues to be developed, I expect the location will be more convenient for many people. However, there is a long line of taxis available at the hotel, public transportation is a short walk away, and there is an on-site garage, so many solutions.","May 6, 2019","10    InterContinental Athenaeum

596,"I have to declare up front I didn’t enjoy visiting Athens. It’s a dump. Almost every square inch is covered in graffiti, it’s generally pig ugly (except for the historic sites and even these are unkempt) and you can taste the pollution. I won’t be returning, ever. So that might colour my view of everything, so I’ll try to be fair to this hotel. First, the rooms are large, with a sofa and seating area, beds very comfortable and public areas generally clean. Prices horrific, €7.50 for a cappuccino €20 for a club sandwich but that’s probably standard for this type of hotel. Gym is pretty good for a hotel gym, pool rather small and disappointing. There’s a spa but didn’t use it. Didn’t have breakfast included in the rate and didn’t want to spend €30 a head. And there lies the problem .. the hotel sits on a busy dual carriageway that is more like a motorway. Roaring traffic noise all day long and nothing very close by in the way of amenities. The concierge will direct you to three restaurants about 10 mins walk away (Flavour is the best of the three and food was good) but you’ll need to walk along a poorly lit, rubble strewn pavement which feels quite unsafe and pass derelict buildings and seedy sex shops on the way. It’s not pleasant. So if you don’t want to be ripped off by the hotel prices you’ll need to head into Athens. The hotel runs a free bus but only on an hourly basis. If you miss it, you’ll need a taxi or to walk ten minutes along the dual carriageway to the nearest metro station from where you can get quickly and cheaply into Athens. Traffic is pretty bad all the time so the bus trip can take 20-30 minutes any time of day. My recommendation would be to use this hotel if you want good quality accommodation at a reasonable price and don’t mind being outside the city centre. However, unless you’re visiting Athens purely to see the historic sites, I’d advise you to look elsewhere because there is very little about this city to fall in love with.","April 21, 2019","10    InterContinental Athenaeum

It's not because it is especially well located or has a great architectural style, it is because it has fantastic views over the city and especially the Acropolis. Having breakfast in the club lounge looking at the ancient world is fantastic. The hotel is located about a half hour drive from the airport and within walking distance of some of Athens best attractions. The rooms are modern and big as are the bathrooms. The only drawback is a lack of power points in the room especially around the bed. There is a great gym with a pool and a full service Spa, great restaurants and bars in the hotel as well as around the hotel.

613,"I was a loyal customer paying a good amount of money for many years and everything was really good. in my last visit my reservation was made with points -Platinum Ambassador- . upon arrival I found out that breakfast was not included. Then with the confidence of the loyal customer who is also a Platinum Ambassador I said to them that they should for once give the breakfast complimentary. Note that these people know me by my name after all these years and we feel comfortable with each other. I was so sure they wouldn't refuse. And then you see how their attitude change and they were negotiating to give me 50% disc. on breakfast. 6 or 7 people( from clerks to managers) talked to me, making me feel bad about my request. I was so embarrassed by the whole situation that I avoided everyone for the rest of my stay. Told them I was not begging and it was a matter of courtesy towards a good customer to offer it by themselves. An that was my last time with them. For a breakfast they lost a loyal customer and they were rude and proud of it.!! Never trust the smile of a person who has to gain something from you.

616,"We stayed here on business and were not totally blown away. A few non “5 star” things occurred - construction in the room above with drills, hammers, etc very early in the morning with no warning, cigarette smoke blowing in through the air conditioning.. and while they moved us for the noise with just a simple mention of the noise, they were very “is everything okay, is everything okay” every five minutes after that, like they were waiting for us to flip out. It was also VERY expensive to dine in the hotel, $60 for breakfast when a few blocks down the street you can get three times as much food for a third of the cost and we also almost got charged for food from the minibar that we did not use. I also worked from the room a lot during the trip and was trying to relax and get things done in the room, sitting on the balcony in my pjs and it seemed like the phone was ringing or someone was knocking on the door every hour with housekeeping or “a gift from the hotel” (some crackers or something.)

617,"My husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Athenaeum for 2 nights on our honeymoon. The hotel held to the InterContinental standard with fine attention to detail, comfortable beds, luxury dining options, and accommodating (if not always the friendliest) staff. However, the location prevents this property from competing with other luxury hotels in Athens. There is a shuttle to and from Syntagma Square but the times aren't always convenient. I would not advise walking as the neighborhood feels less safe the farther you venture from town. We took a cab for less than 5 euro so this didn't make or break our decision to stay.Overall I would recommend the InterContinental Athenaeum if you would like to save a few bucks on luxury accommodations by staying outside the tourist zone.","December 7, 2018","10    InterContinental Athenaeum

619,"Greece for a business trip in November 2018. This hotel was very close to the conference venue - fantastically so, in fact - so I stayed here during my trip.I liked this place a lot. The room was spacious, peaceful and with all the facilities I normally like, and although the decor was a little unusual, it added to the character of the place rather than being distracting. Staff at reception were very helpful indeed, although the room staff were rather keen to pop in for various reasons - it's a good idea to have the 'do not disturb' handy.The main downside of this place for me was a different aspect of the location. While it was close to the event, it was also a decent stroll (~30 mins) from the centre of town, where I also had some meetings set up. Not a problem on a dry day, but Athens isn't the most fun city in the world when it's raining. However, there is always going to be a compromise between meetings in different locations! I'd definitely stay here again if I ended up back in this part of town.","November 27, 2018","10    InterContinental Athenaeum

622,Attending a meeting on week-end it was a rediscovery of this hotel where I had not been for the past 27 years. I was wondering how it would look and what a great surprise as everything there seams to be new or almost. An immaculate bright lobby where the huge Sphere is now stable but otherwise everything is spotless and smiles of staff are all over to make your stay more enjoyable. The Club floor attendance and space with a great terrace overlooking the Parthenon is quiet unique but there again is the impecable friendly service attitude with a touch of distinction that do make you feel welcome.Rooms are large and decorated with clear pastels color schemes that do perfectly reflect lighting and create a lovely atmosphere. The brasserie breakfast is an other positive point offering all what you want and therefore dangerous as you would put weight if you do not control yourself as the display buffet is tempting and colourful in a very nice room with two levels and the pool outside sending a refreshing blue effect of small waves shining on the sun. A perfect stay and week-end of a hotel where every one is well trained and committed to make your stay an unforgettable experience. This for sure can only be if you have an excellent management with sharp eye on the operation and it looks to be the case.Congratulations to the entire hotel to make our week end memorable.

I'm currently staying here with a friend and was surprised to see that the bathrooms do not offer privacy from the rest of the room unless an interior curtain is pulled because the wall is glass. My bed is stiff and uncomfortable, and when I asked for my mini fridge to be emptied so that I could have space for some food I had already bought, they refused. This morning I was awoken by loud chatter in the hallway, so even though they may claim their windows are soundproof, their walls and doors are not. If you love smoking, you'll love this hotel. The hallway of my floor (12) smells like cigarette smoke, and the rooftop bar allows smoking – even cigars.

653,"My third time at the Athens Hilton and they never disappoint. The front desk is attentive and professional. Although the hotels outside is a little tired looking the inside is is modern and spotless. Rooftop Bar is classy and the service is impeccable. The hotel is an easy walk to all the sites, from Syntagma Square to the Acropolis or Plaka. The X95 from Airport (6eu) as does the Red Line City Sight seeing bus stops right across the street. Ion at the front desk was great with our room, will be back on my return to Athena on a week. ","June 9, 2019","11    Hilton Athens

654,"This hotel is large and have very friendly staff and services however it is quite far away from the city attractions. It is not an option if you want to be close to the center. On the other hand, the bus stop for Athens City Sightseeing is just cross the road! Ask the concierge for its exact location.The breakfast buffet was having different local and international varieties with great service. The in room dining was great as well.Although I am loyal to Hilton for many years, but next time I visit Athens i will stay where i can reach the city attractions, restaurants, cafes by short walking distance. This hotel could be very highly recommended for buisness travelers rather than first time visiting tourists.","June 8, 2019","11    Hilton Athens

Every pair of chairs has its own umbrella (no fighting for shade) and table with call button for service. Want a great view of the Acropolis lit up at night? Just go to the rooftop bar and you’ll have one of the best views in town. I’m not one to make a big deal about hotels...as long as it’s clean and I have a place to lay my head at night, I’m happy.

Hotel’s location isn’t that central but not too bad; we took a taxi to the Acropolis museum (~€4) then walked up to the Parthenon and back to the hotel visiting numerous sites along the way back using the multi-site ticket package. The executive lounge has an expansive view of Athens including the Acropolis and the lounge staff were quite hospitable. Breakfast downstairs was more than adequate and featured a couple of local dishes. Had dinner at the nearby Agora Select, which was very good.Someone else checking out at 04.00 received a breakfast goodie-bag; a nice touch that we didn’t ask for ourselves, as it was far too early for us to eat on the road.","May 29, 2019","11    Hilton Athens

We stayed on the executive level (it is worth it), our room was huge and was actually 2 rooms, with 2 BATHROOMS (that is rare). We stay in Hiltons all over the world and this is in the top 3 so far. It was extremely clean as well. The master bathroom was dreamy, all marble, huge tub, amazing shower and sauna. The breakfast buffet was gigantic with tons of options (top 3 as well). It was full of little touches like a lighted face mirror, chocolates on your pillow, huge closets, etc... We also had a view of the Acropolis, granted it was far away but still! The only CON to this is the distance to everything. Even though it's in a great area with stuff all around, you do have to taxi to get to all the main things. Amazing stay.

Service is standard for this price and levelRoom extremely noisy due to traffic though that is not the hotels fault. What is the hotel fault is the failure to PROPERLY inform us that the breakfast is not included (they did that) but not that it cost €35 without a prepaid voucher from reception. So one spoon of scrambled eggs and a toast €35. More expensive than Geneva, London, Milan and even Dubai and it’s Athens.

Clean, marble-clad baths with rain shower and soaking tub, comfy King-sized bed, and a small balcony with table and chairs looking out to the Acropolis and sea were highlights of the room. Evangelismos AthensMetro train station was a short (5 minute) stroll away. The Athens City Sightseeing tourist bus had a stop just across the street while city buses and taxis were also readily available. Our room faced the city and 2 major streets and the sliding door was no match for the street and construction noise. If a light sleeper, I would inquire if rooms facing East toward the residential area behind the hotel might be quieter.

671,"I will start with the good. Hotel is beautiful and has amazing views of the city. Easy to get taxis to and from the airport. It is close to a metro station as well. I liked that the hotel was within walking distance of the Panathenic Stadium, the National Gardens, The Temple of Olympian Zeus, and the Acropolis. Rooms were clean and big for a European hotel. The in-room breakfast option is very nice if you are trying to leave to catch an early flight. I am not referring to room service, but the card hangers on the door.The bad/less than stellar is as follows. It is farther away from the Monstaraki area which has shops, the flea market, and the cities municipal market. It is not within walking distance of the Roman Agora, the Ancient Agora of Athens or the Temple of Hephaestus. All the restaurants within the hotel are very over priced for what you get. I would not eat there if it could be avoided. The pools and gym are not free unless you have certain level of Hilton status. The hotel places a 100€ a night hold on your credit card. 6 nights would be a 600€ hold on the card. This was never mentioned during booking or check in and it took several days to ""fall off"". There were also random fees on my itemized bill that were never explained.","May 12, 2019","11    Hilton Athens

673,"What can we say about the Hilton Athens except they did everything right. We are Hilton Honors members, and used two nights of Honors points for a brief stay on our way to Rome. The hotel welcomed us at the front desk, gave us a key to the elevator to go to the 11th floor Honors lounge for check-in, which was fast and seamless. Our room was on the 12th floor and was very nice. It had a huge bathroom with soaking tub, rain-shower, sink and toilet, an abundance of storage for hanging and folding clothes, a bed that was absolutely top notch in comfort and a beautiful balcony and city view. The air conditioning and all electronics worked well, and the wi-fi (normal) was plenty fast. It gets better.We went downstairs to see the health club and spa. Very impressive! You have to walk two floors below the lobby but the walk is worth it as the spa has just about everything you could want. Indoor swimming pool, hot tub/jacuzzi, a fitness center with actual dumbbells, a smith machine, a variety of pre-core strength machines and a nice selection of cardio equipment. The spa also offers aerobics classes as well as steam and sauna facilities in the changing rooms. Finally, the spa is open until 11pm. Of note, though we did not use it, there is also a very large outdoor swimming pool that also offers plenty of chairs for sunning and an outdoor patio restaurant. This is the way a premium hotel spa should be done. Well done, Hilton!Both mornings we had the buffet breakfast (included in our room) and it was outstanding. Omelette station, a wide selection of hot food, salad, meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads and fruits were all well-laid out and in abundance. They also had a gluten-free section of foods, and offered a nice selection of juices and breakfast pastries. Whatever your palette, you’ll find it here.Staying on the food theme, they also have a chocolate/sweet store in the lobby, and part of their selling point is that many of their items are sugar free. Following a Ketogenic eating style, we were impressed to find almost half of what they sold was made with Stevia (sugar substitute). We sampled a few pieces and the taste was excellent.The hotel is very modern and organized, and presents a very premium feeling from the moment you walk in. The staff was also attentive and helpful, whether it was the attendants in the lounge or the desk staff in helping direct us where to catch the bus. To a person, the service was excellent.Finally, the location of the hotel is convenient if you desire to see the Acropolis and several of the surrounding historical sites. It’s about a 30 minute walk to the Acropolis, which takes you past the Parliament building (with the tomb of the unknown soldier), the temple of Olympian Zeus, and a few shopping areas. There is also convenient access to both bus and subway within 5 - 10 minutes walk from the hotel. In fact, just so you’re aware, figure 40 Euros to take a taxi to the hotel or from the hotel to the airport. We instead took the X95 bus which cost 6 Euros per person and it took us about 45 minutes each way. For dinner, we walked 5 minutes behind the main lobby of the hotel to find a selection of Greek restaurants, one of which is where we had dinner on our last night. The restaurant name is elia taverna, and they serve a plentiful selection of grilled meats at a reasonable price. Oh, and the owner dropped a nice little bonus on us with a complimentary brownie after dinner. Overall, the Hilton Athens was outstanding and we would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to spend a few days in Athens to see the amazing historical sites.Pro’s+ Location to Acropolis, other historical sites and restaurants+ Gym/Fitness Center and Spa+ Breakfast Buffet+ Staff service and attentiveness+ Honors lounge - large and had GREAT views of the Acropolis+ Bed - absolutely comfortable+ Room size and amenities+ Chocolate/sweet shop selection of sugar free items+ Convenience to public transportationCon’s- We did not get an Acropolis view room (seriously, this is nitpicking...)","May 9, 2019","11    Hilton Athens

676,"The Hilton was sold a couple of years ago and the new owners need to carry out a major refurbishment as it has become very scruffy, apart from the pool area and the Galaxy Bar. Whereas the staff are excellent, the material of the hotel and its appearance have gone badly downhill. The water feature outside the hotel has been abandoned, the facade is both dirty and needs work, the lobby is devoid of decoration, the lifts have a mind of their own at times and my room needed maintenance.But what the Hilton does not tell you is that, unless you make your booking yourself, and not via a travel agent or a company, you will not receive any Hilton Honors points for your stay!I am a business traveller and just how many tourists or business travellers make their booking themselves? Very few indeed is the answer. So, the only benefit of being on the Hilton Honors award scheme is free wifi - a slow speed connection that all other hotels in this category (and all airbnbs) give you for free!The shower, at least in my room, was not thermostatically controlled so, in the mornings in particular, the water temperature will go from normal to boiling hot to cold in a matter of seconds. Not good for the elderly or those trying to have a romantic stay!Try to book a room as far from the main road in front of the hotel as possible as it is long and straight and the motorbikes will keep you awake at night as they scream past.Altogether very disappointing.","April 30, 2019","11    Hilton Athens

686,"When planning my solo trip to Greece, I see-sawed between staying in Plaka, Monastiraki, and Psiri because I read these were safe neighborhoods near the key attractions. I even checked the places Rick Steves uses for his tours. So many choices. But in the end, I chose to go with the more modern hotel who could provide me with amenities that would make me comfortable after a long day in the sun (I.e., air conditioner and a great shower).I checked in around 11 a.m., which is early. The front desk checked and had me go to the sixth floor to enjoy a drink on the house. The view was great, but I worried whether the koi fishes boiled under the sun. Hopefully they have access to enough shade and cool water.When the sweet tall guy fetched me, I was told they upgraded me to a junior suite. Yay! I got a view of the Acropolis. Besides the room, which was very comfortable, the fact that the metro is literally seconds outside of the door made walking about Athens a breeze. The metro reminded me of Sweden's metro system - easy and clean. Just use common sense and take precautions against thieves. Read about pick pocketers and/or watch ""Scam City"" on Netflix to learn ways to better secure your belongings.When I returned from my four day tour, I returned to Wyndham Athens Residence for a night. They told me because of issues caused by the rain the previous days (we had hail, lightning, and rain while traveling to Delphi), I was being given a room at the Wyndham Grand where once again I got a room with a view of the Acropolis. The Grand is more of a plush hotel than the Residence, but I preferred the latter because of the metro entrance and the gyro place right across the street. Sure, the Wyndham Grand is just a hop away and had a more expensive feel to it, but location put the Residence ahead of the mothership.*If you're like me, bring or purchase your own lotion as the hotel provided shampoo, body wash, and conditioner, but no lotion. **If you allow housekeeping to fix up your room, the complimentary water will be replenished along with the two complimentary pods of coffee. ***Everyone at the hotel is super friendly and helpful, although the older housekeeper seems irritated.****Make sure to use the latch on your door or someone may surprise you. I was recovering from my long flight and slept for a few hours the first day I arrived. In the late afternoon, I awoke to someone opening my door. Thank goodness my latch secured my door.

The Wyndham Residence was very clean and I had a super view of the city. We had access to the Wyndham Grand across the street. This Wyndham has fabulous views of the Acropolis and the city from the rooftop, but the restaurant and bar service was awful. I went to the bar to get a drink and was told I had to let the server take my order. The server never came to our table, so we left. I wouldn't stay there, and realize the Wyndham Residence has much better service .","June 25, 2019","12    Wyndham Athens Residence

688,"Let's start with the great:The staff was fabulous! From the Front Desk to the Doorman (David) to the restaurant staff they were superb. Housekeeping not so much but the others were top notch!The rooms were large for Europe and the beds and pillows were amazing.Breakfast was very good. Lots of options and nice service. But now the not so great:The rooms are weird. Finish of the rooms were way sub par. Toilet paper roll holder in all 4 of our rooms was lose and didn't hold the paper so it was always falling on the floor. One of out toilet seats was broken when we arrived. They did fix it but how is that acceptable?The closet is behind the door to the room so you have to close the door to the suite to get into the closet. Annoying when you have a suite with an adjoining room and want to keep the doors open. Closets had a full size ironing board in them taking up 1/2 the space. There were about 6 hangers and no shelves. One shelf was broken.The vanity in the restroom was tiny and the sink huge. No room for toiletries. Also no soap dish so the bar soap was in the sink all of the time.Showers had 1/2 walls so the floor was always getting wet. Towel hooks were crooked. Additionally there was glue from the tiles all over everything. Back of the bathroom doors, tiles, mirrors. Any the toilet seat was stained with yellow spots which they said were due to a wrong cleaning chemical but gross nonetheless.All of these are simply annoyances but for the #2 or #3 hotel in Athens it's unacceptable.Also be careful walking in Athens. The metro is super convenient and there are a few decent restaurants just across the street. We liked Mironi and Alexander very much. But be careful walking more than 5 minutes away from the hotel It gets very sketchy, very fast.","June 24, 2019","12    Wyndham Athens Residence

Special mention to Cristos who was super helpful with any request we had. The rooms are more apartment like than hotel like which we didn’t quite gauge from the pictures, not many soft touches and basic interior but functional. The gym isn’t great, has two running machines which make a lot of noise but you can go across the road to the hotel and use their gym which has exactly the same equipment but just a bit larger and cooler as it’s not as exposed to sunlight. Location wise the hotel is superb and located a true twenty minute walk from all the attractions of Athens.

704,"We had a great experience w/the hotel and staff from arrival to departure! The staff arranged our pick-up from the airport. Our room was upgraded to a junior suite (luck of the draw, I guess). We had a city view room. Several comments rated the city view as a negative, however, it was not an issue w/us at all. We were able to get to sleep each night easily (we also kept the curtains opened, as it was a pleasant view to fall asleep to looking out at the hill). Demetrius and Martha and the entire staff to include the doormen were excellent managers and a tremendous help with assisting us to navigate our daily trips. The staff at the rooftop bar were great as well and what a nice view! Our hotel room was really nice and had USB ports to charge your mobile devices. The location was great, particularly if you don’t mind walking...close to the high points of the city or there are hop on hop off buses that stop in front of the hotel if you prefer not to walk and it’s also very easy to catch a cab right out front.

716,"My partner and I flew in from South Africa for an extended long weekend. This coincided by chance with Greek Orthodox Easter. We chose this hotel by virtue of its high scoring reviews and proximity to a metro. We were welcome by Anna and Christopher with warmth, smiles and a genuine desire to make us feel welcome and at home. First impressions last. The lobby while small is neat and stylish but this is well overcome by the welcome. Our hotel room was more than adequate. It is modern, stylish and comfortable with all the amenities of a 4/5 star hotel. They went out of their way to make sure we were happy at all times. Our small requests were met with smiles and efficient service. Given the religious time over which we were visiting, the hospitality was even more than we expected. The cultural touches of the traditional bread on welcoming and the candles to help us experience the midnight service (that they advised we attend) would have been something we would have missed out on and are grateful we were able to experience. With changes of shifts, each new team also went out of their way to introduce themselves and ask if we needed anything.Breakfast was wide and varied and I loved the local touches. The views from the outdoor balcony area on the top floor from which to enjoy the morning sun was definitely outshone by the morning service. It was friendly, convivial and the picture definition of warmth.I am a stickler for details. When a hotel gets the basics right and have the right team...you don't have a hotel but a home away from home. Dimitris on our last morning as we took all our baggage down to check out, offered us the chance to use the room to keep our luggage and for us to have a shower before the long journey back. The names I mention above are merely the ones who stood out. But this should no way detract from the team effort it takes to pull of such sterling service. I would HIGHLY recommend a stay here and would gladly return and pay more for this kind of attentive and compassionate service from a young team. The passion is evident.Thank you Wyndham Athens Residence. It is not often that a hotel will stay part of my memory of a holiday. These memories I will cherish. You all are outstanding and should be commended.","April 30, 2019","12    Wyndham Athens Residence

723,"My wife and I checked in to Wyndham Grand Residence Athens yesterday for 2nights. We booked the hotel because of excellent reviews at Hotel.com and Agoda.Indeed our experience in this hotel so far has exceeded our expectations. First the front desk and the general manager on duty were very supportive and helpful. I was pickpocketed at Metro on our way to the hotel. But the friendly staff of this hotel by going extra miles has helped us to overcome our trauma. Next the restaurant staff are very friendly. Food is simple but nice. The backdrop of Acropolis from far and the cozy environment making the dining experience relaxed and enjoying. (Though improve lighting in the restaurant will make the place even better)The room design is very warm and welcoming. The bed and pillows are comfortable. The amenities in the room also impressive for the price that we paid. The self serviced business centre comes handy for simple printing like the boarding pass. Simple to use and it is free.Last but it least, the location being not that far away to Acropolis has made us easy to walk there without calling cab. In short, we will visit again this hotel if we are back to Athens next time.","April 20, 2019","12    Wyndham Athens Residence

724,"First impressions were really bad! It’s on a noisy and busy roundabout, quite a few rough streets very close by, no real lobby just a small corridor. The staff at check in were friendly and helpful.Room was fine (we booked a suite), quite spacious, bed was really comfy, no bath but good shower. Tried to order room service as soon as we arrived but after two phone calls and some confusion we were told there wasn’t really any room service but the kitchen could do some toast- never had this before in a 5* hotel. We decided to walk to the old town- not far, just over 2kms. Within 50 metres of the hotel were some very dodgy looking streets, people clearly high, dirty needle on the pavement and lots of people sleeping rough. We aren’t easily put off and travel a lot but this area was definitely rough and I would not have walked there alone. Put it this way we didn’t walk there when it was dark and the taxis that took us back to the hotel in evening leant over and locked the car doors when we got to these streets!Had a massage at the other Wyndham hotel across the road- it was pretty good, although the ‘spa’ is actually just one treatment room right off the main hotel corridor.Overall, staff were helpful and friendly, rooms are fine but it is nowhere near the standard of a 5* hotel and the area is, in my opinion, rough. If we were to come again to Athens, I would definitely stay in the old town.","April 20, 2019","12    Wyndham Athens Residence

726,"I managed to find this hotel through the Wyndham app and as I am a rewards member I thought why not. I was not disappointed. Situated across the road from its sister hotel the Wyndham Grand it is ideally located for getting around Athens due to the fact that there is a Metro station on the next corner. Depending on which sort of room you get your view will be the statue of Icarus falling, which is to commemorate Greek fallen aviators, or the back of an adjoining hotel. In honesty, I would choose the later as the front can be very noisy with traffic but that is only a minor point. I was here for 2 weeks but if you stay as a tourist it would more than likely not matter. On arrival the staff are 'extremely' helpful and genuinely happy to see you. The rooms are well laid out with all the amenities you require. The roof restaurant/bar is pleasant but there is not a full evening menu however guests are more than welcome to use all the facilities of the Grand. I have actually stayed at this hotel twice now but this is the first time I've had the chance to write a review. Magda, the manager, is infectiously happy and will do everything that she can to ensure that your stay is satisfactory. Will I stay again, a definite yes as Magda was able to sort me out a room for 2 weeks during a busy period. Thank you for that. One last thing to add. The staff who work the bar are amazing. See you again in a couple of weeks. ","April 17, 2019","12    Wyndham Athens Residence

732,"The hotel situates in an area feeling like a rough end of town and on a roundabout. Front door to main road is probably 5 metres, hence all traffic noise is very loud in the room. True nightmare for a light sleeper, also all the beeping going into late night triggered even more annoyance. Although traffic and beeping was not the hotel’s fault but in room could have been better, noise in the reception area was noticeably quieter than in guest room. Room is small despite got upgraded to junior suite, cleanliness was good though. Air-con was not doing a good job either. Corridor was way cooler than inside the room. Only other good things are it is close to a metro station and cake shop is next door. Selection of food at the cake shop (also has savoury choices) is larger than breakfast choices at the hotel.

For 6euros the breakfast is outstanding for such a freshly made meal, it’s a pity they don’t serve dinner as well. From arriving to leaving the hotel staff were helpful with maps and advice. It’s a 10 minute walk to the express airport bus or 10 minutes to the metro. This hotel warrants a third star.

752,"hello fellow traveler, if you stoped to check this property, then you are attracted by the very reasonable price, then you are on a budget, second you might have been attracted by the location of this property. so as a combination of price and location and most other positive reviews this is an excellent deal.i do not understand why others nag about their stay here, about the size of the rooms, and the busy streets and the cathedral bells. and they wrote a review here. if you already know the way to tripadvisor to write a bad review then why you didnt find your way here before booking and read the previous reviews!?anyway , face it. i stayed 6 nights in this hotel for the price equivalent for almost 2 nights in a 4 star hotel in the same area. and equivalent for the price of 1 night stay at a 5 stars hotel.yes the rooms are small, but we lived in my wife and i , both with massive lagguge bags.yes the elevator is tiny but i used up and down all my stay period my wife and i knowing that i am 190 cm tall and weighing 140 KG.yes the streets are busy , you are in a perfect location in the center of a european capital.what do you expect ? go to the maldives.yes the cathedral bell ring once every hour, and three bells on specific times. unless you are a very light sleeper you wont sense the presence of the whole cathedral when you are sleeping after a long day discovering athens on foot.the room on the 3rd floor was so clean and neat, the sheets are new and clean,bathroom is renovated, cool shower sprinklers . rooms gets done everyday i was there in the new year period, cold weather outside, the radiator heater inside does the job perfectly.i booked via hotels.com, when i arrived to the hotel i just gave in my passport, and directly got the key card. i knew that it is a family run hotel, you would see two guys , an elderly man and a woman occupying the front desk within different shifts. they are all so friendly and helpful , always smiling answering your queries and recommending places and routes. they arranged the taxi pickup for my departure to the airport without any extra charge knowing that the trip from and to the airport is fixed 39 euros. the taxi was waiting for me outside.they offer breakfast, but i never tried it, i preferred waking up late and eating some tasety pastries nearby.the location is unbeatable, less than 5 monutes walk to syntagma and around 5 mins to monastiraky. thos are the two main squares in athena area with the metro stations. 10 mins walk to the acropolis. ermou street is just behind the hotel.","January 16, 2019","13    Hotel Metropolis

757,"We thought we were booking the Electra Metropolis when we booked this hotel in error. And what an error that was! Located on the corner of two of the busiest streets in Athens, this is no more than a dingy conversion of a block of flats. ""Reception"" is a desk tucked under the staircase and the very small elevator took us to a very dark floor and our awful room, a tiny space with nowhere but the bed to unpack the suitcase on. Describing the furniture as ""tired"" would be a kind exaggeration, I can only describe it as ""exhausted"".The ""balcony"" was a tiny space overlooking the non-stop traffic below with all its noise. Yes, you can see the Acropolis in the distance as well as the Metropolis Cathedral but the problem here is that you have no space in the room from where to admire the view, the balcony is uncomfortable and noisy and the Cathedral bells boom out with mathematical regularity.The bathroom was like a scene from Faulty Towers. When we tried to use the hand towel the holder came clean off the wall and when we tried to close the shower curtain, the metal bar holding the curtain up came crushing down on my head. Instead of due concern, this caused amusement to the man at the reception desk when I reported it to him.We were only there for one night and have no intention to ever return. My biggest concern was that in case of an earthquake there was very little chance of us getting out of this building safely. The noise is continuous and loud and the serious lack of space is utterly frustrating. The other issue we had was that although we had been reassured that the hotel accepts American Express, when we came to paying, the receptionist insisted that our card was not being accepted. We challenged him as we had used it without problems the day before and he became aggressive. He offered to take a cash payment, however, we insisted on paying with our Visa card. Incidentally, our American Express continued to be accepted everywhere else we presented it.I am perplexed by the glowing reviews that others have left, I really am.","October 22, 2018","13    Hotel Metropolis

Strangely though, when we were out there one evening, a window opened and a head popped out. The room next door had a bathroom window that opened onto our balcony. Very bizarre. I must also admit, that i don't think i've ever been in a lift that made me so nervous!It's tiny (you can just about fit 2 people and 2 bags in there) and open on one side, so you can see the walls going past!I only ever used it when i was tired, and preferred the four flights of stairs instead.","September 19, 2018","13    Hotel Metropolis

767,"This place served it’s purpose. It was just a rest stop along the way to the cyclades. We didn’t really expect much from it. The front desk staff was really nice and very helpful with recommending how to spend our only nights in Athens. Luckily it was located very conveniently close to Plaka and to the Monastiraki. The elevator was scary lol. It’s so small and every time I used it I just prayed I wouldn’t get stuck. Honestly, I could touch all four walls of the room by standing in the middle of it. It was so small! We stayed here twice. Both rooms were so small but the first room was smaller. The first room had a small balcony which was nice to go out on to get fresh air. The second room had only a window. The first room had really good AC that was working very well, and it would even work when we left the room. The second room needed the room key in order for it to work. It didn’t work well at all and we were sweating during the night. Overall, like I said, the hotel served it’s purpose. I wasn’t expecting anything more than a 2 - star hotel. We’re thankful for the staff and for helping us out with booking taxis and recommendations.","August 19, 2018","13    Hotel Metropolis

768,This little hotel is in the best possible location for exploring Athens. We (a family of four) stayed the first 3 nights of our trip here and it was perfect. The rooms are basic but clean. The WiFi worked great. The staff was friendly. We didn’t have breakfast on the roof because there was a fantastic bakery near the hotel. In short we would recommend this little gem and stay again. ,"August 17, 2018","13    Hotel Metropolis

The Syntagma Square is wonderful with lots of restaurants, some within 3 minutes walk. it is within walking distance to many historical sites and shopping areas. The breakfast is simple but with the view of the Acropolis! The rooms are adequate, clean, and functional. If you don't mind the church bell every half hour (we were not bothered by it at all), then it is a perfect place to stay. The elevator is tiny but functional. One has to climb a few steep steps to reach it though. If you book it on their web site you could get 5-10% discount. I think the code is 43 (sorry don't remember it now).

776,"When I stepped out onto the balcony, I practically fell over my own jaw in delight. Almost as big as the room, it looked right up at the Parthenon and right across a green square to the Orthodox Cathedral in range of its bells. Management encouraged me to picnic there! The Metropolis is a two star hotel deserving three stars for value and five stars for its view. My greeting was enthusiastic, in fluent English and helpful. A solo traveler, I had booked the last available room, #51, on the top residential floor. Advertised for a family, it would have been very satisfactory for a couple and child. It was very clean and bright with a queen bed and a single bed in an alcove, but definitely a one-at-a-time bathroom. Gear included a small fridge, hair dryer, safe, and three sets of generic toiletries. Free Wi-Fi. There’s a small TV and an accommodating IKEA style desk. A strong in-wall AC is controlled by remote. Breakfast is spare but inexpensive. There is a lift, but there are also a lot of stairs—up to the front door, up to the elevator, and finally up from the fifth floor to the enclosed rooftop breakfast room. It’s ordinary fare with that extraordinary view. Pluses are the plunging distance to the Plaka, rambling distance to the Acropolis, and a street full of convenience shopping and rows of cafes.","June 5, 2018","13    Hotel Metropolis

779,"Everything about this hotel is on the small side.....the reception area is tiny, the elevator is miniscule, the rooms and bathrooms are also very small but the location is absolutely perfect! The hotel sits between Syntagma Square and Monastiraki Square and is just a few blocks from Plaka, the main shopping area of Athens. The rooftop terrace on the 5th floor overlooks the main cathedral and has a lovely view of Acropolis Hill and the Parthenon. Despite its small size, all of the rooms and common areas of the hotel are spotlessly clean, toiletries and hairdryers are provided, there is a small mini-frig in each room, air conditioning and free wi-fi. The hotel staff is very accommodating and helpful. They will order cabs for you to Piraeus port and the airport and even print your boarding passes. Breakfast is offered on the rooftop terrace for an additional 6 euros but it is very basic and there are numerous restaurants nearby which offer more variety. If you are a light sleeper, be forewarned that the cathedral bells chime on the hour. This didn't bother us because we live in Mexico so we are used to the sound of bells, roosters, barking dogs, etc. But if you on on a budget and want a central location, within walking distance of most Athens attractions, at a reasonable price, you should definitely consider Hotel Metropolis.

It's located less than a 10 minute walk from two metro stations, about 10-15 minutes from the Acropolis and all the main sights, and there is tons of great eating around Plaka within 5-10 minutes. Spring for the room with the Acropolis view! We had drinks on our 5th floor balcony each night overlooking the cathedral across the street and the illumined Parthenon atop the Acropolis. It was awesome. We had breakfast one morning on the roof which had an amazing view too. The room was definitely not large but I think that's just Athens/Europe for you. Don't worry about it, just sleep here and spend the rest of your time exploring the city. The staff was really helpful and proactive too. They were great for restaurant tips (check out Mnisikleous Street in Plaka aka The Plaka Steps) and they helped us get a cab to the airport at the end of our stay.Summary: Great location, awesome value, really helpful staff, amazing view.","May 9, 2018","13    Hotel Metropolis

Very convenient location for almost all of the sights--right on the edge of the Plaka across the street from the Metropolis cathedral (the bells of which do chime on every hour, and once on every half-hour, but the noise didn't bother me as much as it did other reviewers). The room was basic but comfortable, with a nice view from the balcony of the cathedral below and of the Acropolis. There was a little miscommunication with our booking through Expedia--they gave us two twin beds instead of one double bed, and the front desk clerk made it feel like it was our fault for having used Expedia. That same clerk also tried to talk us out of taking the bus to Sounio and insisted we hire a private car instead. We didn't take his advice, but for most other information he and the other front desk clerks were helpful and very friendly (and VERY talkative). I'd stay here again, but probably book with them directly to avoid any miscommunication.","February 8, 2018","13    Hotel Metropolis

788,"The title says all you need to know. This place is noisy, and if you want to sleep at night (or during the day) you should avoid it. Unfortunately I did not, and spent four nights getting maybe 3-4 hours of sleep a night. To begin, it is on a busy street, a street where traffic runs pretty constant until the early morning hours. Next, the rooms are directly underneath an outdoor restaurant, which is routinely busy past midnight, with sounds wafting up to the rooms. Finally, there is a church right across the street with a bell that tolls on the hour and makes a prolonged toll at 7:30 am. Since it is really not practical to get to bed before one or two, that gives you about five yours of sleep. Don't expect a closed window to protect you from the noise: it won't. I should add that the rooms are incredibly, incredibly tiny. And overpriced. The truth is, there are hotel rooms that are much cheaper, bigger, and quieter in the Plaka area, and if you want to enjoy your visit to Athens, you will find one of those.","November 2, 2017","13    Hotel Metropolis

The area isn’t just URBAN, like the management seems to imply - it is blocks away from a seedy, unsafe, druggie-infested part of the city, which other reviewers have mentioned (I wish I have read these reviews before I actually arrived but hey, I trusted the brand!!). SEVERAL cab drivers rolled up the windows driving me and my kids to the hotel advising us that the area wasn’t safe, telling us to not leave to hotel after dark and generally to watch out leaving their car. What we have seen out of the windows looked like a Zombie Apocalypse!! And we come from NYC people!! We were truly spooked, especially the kids. AVOID if you can! The service itself it also spotty. While some people (Kleandra!!) are amazing...the rooms aren’t turned down at night. Some people at our party were lectured that their rooms didn’t come with a free breakfast WHILE eating breakfast? Also, I was held up by John at reception at 2 am to process my credit card for what seems like forever after having already waited for an arriving person for close to an hour.

We were then offered an upgrade for early check in (everything is an upgrade), From the €28 for WiFi, to the daily water (which wasn’t daily). Breakfasts are not worth €40 a day by the way. The rooms are small, not suitable for anything more than an overnight stay. The shower gels were empty when we arrived and remained so. The spa does not have full time therapists. When they arrived they were late, set up while we were there and gave poor massages; next to a weight room by the way. The spa on the roof pool doesn’t work properly and the food when served up there arrives cold. My guess is kitchens are a few floors down The surrounding area is dilapidated and graffiti ridden. We also upgraded to a late checkout and had phones ringing and cleaners arriving at 12. And then to cap it off their card machine would not accept my card. We left more stressed than when we arrived.

805,I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and the hotel was lovely and clean and great pool area. However the area is NOT SAFE! I was mugged outside the hotel on my second night. When reported to hotel staff and police we were told this was a regular thing and the police told us we were not safe in this area. Please do not walk anywhere at night and use taxis which are not too expensive. Also there were riots between students and police where tear gas was used and could still feel the effects hours after. Riot police were present outside the hotel every day and it was very scary.I'm writing this review to make people we aware as if we had known before we would we never of walked anywhere and probably would of had to go through the horrifying ordeal of being mugged and threatened with metal bars! So please stay safe as the hotel played down the danger for obvious reasons.,"June 13, 2019","14    Melia Athens

I knew it was walking distance from everything which I don’t mind exploring ect but I don’t want to explore druggies/ homeless thugs. There was crack heads jumping at you.. people following close by and people taking heroin. Graffiti and rubbish every where.

We asked for a quite room on a higher level to avoid street noise and had no issues with our room. It was clean and bed was very comfortable, No issues with the AC. Breakfast was perfect with something for everyone. Yes the neighborhood is a bit shady but I felt most of Athens was as well, we walked to and from the main areas of town day and night and never felt truly unsafe. Yes there where sketchy sections but all in all our stay was wonderful, thank you Melia Athens.","June 13, 2019","14    Melia Athens

The rooms were spacious and the shower was great. I can't fault the actual hotel and the staff are amazing. However, we were on the first floor and the view of the street isn't nice. The area this hotel is situated in is quite run down/rough and I didn't feel safe. There are a lot of homeless/drug addicts roaming the streets and we were approached numerous times. Saying that taxis are cheap enough to get to the nicer parts of the city or you could walk just avoid the dodgy streets.","June 12, 2019","14    Melia Athens

The view from the pool area on the roof is of the Acropolis - albeit through a maze of antennas.The breakfast provided many options and was fresh and tasty. The neighbourhood was a bit confronting, with many homeless and drug users in the squares nearby in the evenings - but when we were moving after dark we just grabbed a taxi which cost us about 10 Euro. We felt safe walking around during the day and it was only a 10-15 minute walk into the heart of the tourist area.The staff were excellent and very helpful, even calling the tour that we had booked previously, to organise a hotel pick up for us.","May 31, 2019","14    Melia Athens

812,"We recently spent three nights at the Meliá Athens. The hotel itself is pleasant and worthy of its four star status. It has a nice rooftop pool and bar, with views of the Acropolis, and the food and drink at the hotel is nice, if not a little over priced. The staff were friendly and all very efficient and quick to help.The issue is the location. It doesn’t feel particularly safe and is a bit of a walk to the main sights and more pleasant areas to walk around. Taxis are however relatively cheap and easy enough to find. We didn’t feel safe walking around the neighbourhood in the evening. On departure our taxi driver informed us that the hotel is just two blocks from a hospital that issues methadone to addicts on a daily basis. It’s a shame, but because of the location I would strongly advice against staying here and certainly wouldn’t book again.","May 26, 2019","14    Melia Athens

If you get a room on the outer side, don’t expect to sleep without earplugs unless if you don’t mind the non-stop noise of buses passing and motorbikes accelerating.When I complained to the staff after my first night, they were not able to change my room because they said I had to pack my things although I was in a hurry to go for a business meeting. That evening, they still didn’t have a solution. When I invited a staff member to come to my room and listen to the noise, he did, and then kindly (very kindly actually) explained to me that the problem was me - that other guests don’t complain and are able to sleep with the noise of buses and motorcycles.This hotel first needs to recognize this massive problem and then renovate or completely change their triple glass isolation windows.","April 11, 2019","14    Melia Athens

Temperature controls were not easily explained, so hot and uncomfortable or cool and very noisy.The hotel has a bar, apparently, but never saw it open.Drinking water is charged at €3 a bottle from the mini bar. This is the first hotel of this standard where bottled water isn't complementary.WiFi is advertised as free, but on activation this is shown as for 3 days only at login.To sum up, massively overrated.

Hotel is located a walk away from the main areas but that was fine with us. We didn’t use public transport but would appear to be easily accessible to the hotel. Room was very warm but staff quickly sorted this out by providing a fan. Breakfast was as you’d expect from a hotel, a mix of cooked and continental, fresh fruit etc. Only minor observation is the room could have been slightly cleaner. Dust in some areas, water marks on glass bathroom door from previous occupant. The rooms were cleaned daily though, even on their bank holiday. Unfortunately the roof garden and pool were not open during our stay which was shame as we experienced some lovely weather. The coffee at breakfast, the cafe or room service was very good.

847,"I have to give it this rating based on the personal cons I experienced. Let me say if it wasn't for these circumstances - it probably would have got 4.5 This review is for Athens Backpackers (not Studio) and for a mixed 6 dormitory bed with shared bathroom.The CONS:1) TOILET PAPER Each floor gets one roll a morning. For 18 beds. Especially as a female, toilet paper is very needed for all our bathroom needs - one roll is not sufficient enough for 18 beds. Yes, we can ask reception - which we did. A friend advised reception and their response was ""perhaps the housecleaner hasn't gone in yet."" I went down an hour later, advising again that toilet paper was gone. I would assume that multiple people were advising reception of the lack of toilet paper. 2) WIFI. The wifi was not sufficient enough to make a call via skype, facebook without lags / cut outs. It wasn't able to stream, download and if you say wanted to upload a video it'd fail, or you may need to re-upload a photo on IG.3) SCHOOL KIDS. While I was staying, a group of maybe 25 school kids (university) were staying there also. This is fine if a hostel wants to do this - but it disrupts the environment of a hostel, as solo travellers, groups etc - to meet others it essentially takes out experiences you could otherwise have. Not only this, they went on the walking tour and instead of receiving information about Athens I mostly remember just the teachers yelling and repeating incorrect information. It would have been best if they had two walking tours, one for the hostel guests and another with the school groups. We also weren't advised until we'd paid (7 euros) so it wasn't like we could just not do it, it then felt uncomfortable to ask for funds back.THE PROS: They have comfy beds, lockers, high-pressure shower, key cards, amazing location, staff off and on helpful depending who you get, decent free breakfast. As I said, If I stayed in the Studio (apparently have lots of toilet paper) or came at a different time (no school groups) then I'd probably rate it 4.5 stars.","March 20, 2019","15    Athens Backpackers

849,"i started traveling all around the world about 3 years ago , I've been to many countries and stayed in many places .Italy is considered a Mediterranean country so i thought i have to visit Greece too.On my first day i checked in and the guy with the hat welcomed me with a big smile ,friendly and gave me a lot of information.I stayed in a dorm with 3 more guys ,the room was clean and spacious.Free breakfast was served at the reception by pit, he also makes good bread fried on eggs .The location is excellent close to most of the archeological sights which can be discovered by the walking tour offered by the hostel.The highlight of this hostel was the rooftop bar which had a really nice view.Although the sound system of the bar was unable to play sounds loudly , the bartender Lucas was very funny and social and his ability to introduce everybody ,helped everyone make new friendships. Interesting stories about the city and funny jokes had everyone sat at the bar! (p.s try the blue lagoon cocktail )","October 21, 2018","15    Athens Backpackers

It’s so close to the Akropolis and the city center but still pretty quite during the night. The bathroom maybe needs a little update and also the AC couldn’t reach the back bunk beds but overal the rooms are nice. The rooftop bar is really a must do. The view is amazing.

We wasted 2+ hrs of our time waiting on the host and then waiting for him to be able to unlock the door. So frustrating!! So, we had to figure out somewhere else to stay. This was during ‘spring break’ and lots of travelers and tourists everywhere! We were afraid we weren’t going to be able to find a place. But! Athens backpackers had beds for us!! Made us feel right at home after a frustrating evening and guided us to a restaurant that served us like queens! Amazing stay. Decently priced and a place to stay.

The vibe of the staff was relaxed and very welcoming, and the other guests were friendly and interesting. The only negative thing was that my friends and I booked the same room together and were separated in groups of two into different rooms.

871,"I travel solo (by motorcycle) and stay in hotels, but sometimes it's nice to meet fellow travelers so this hostel is perfect for that. After all, it's just for a night or 2 stay for me and I don't need 5 star stuff. This hostel is well run and very clean. But the location on a quiet street in the Plaka area is the best part of this accommodation. For 30 euros a night you'd have to go to the Omonia (ugh!) district for a hotel. The Plaka is very safe and full of restaurants (but go to nearby Monasteraki area for cheaper restaurants). I recommend a 3 bed dorm room if you're interested in getting some sleep because the 6 bed dorms have more coming and going at all hours. I stayed in a 6 bed dorm and one inconsiderate individual played with his mobile phone until 2:30am in the morning. The rooftop bar is nice, but very small so get there early if you want a seat.

876,"I originally found this hostel on another site which had great reviews. However, I have to say I wasn't overly impressed and was surprised they have won awards. I tend to only stay at the nicer hostels on my world travels so I was a little shocked when I got here. With that said, there are still some good things associated with this hostel. The good: 1) Great location- It's near the Acropolis,the subway, and many restaurants. It's a popular tourist spot obviously so the restaurants can sometimes pester you to go to their restaurant. If you take a taxi to get to the hostel it can be a little more confusing depending on where your driver drops you off, but the subway would make it super easy to/from the airport. 2)There's a rooftop patio/bar area which is open during the summer months which has a nice backdrop of the Acropolis. It is rather small so don't be fooled by the pictures though. 3)There's a great walking tour setup through the company which is available at their sister property a short walk away. 4)Good size lockers5)The Front desk sells cheap water and beer The bad:1)The rooms weren't nearly as nice as the photos. The photos might have been taking awhile ago and doesn't reflect how the rooms currently look. 2)Not many electrical outlets and the few are in bad spots to utilize 3)Bathroom/shower tends to flood and is very small in the rooms which have it. (not sure on the community ones)4)Free breakfast was very basic and almost not worth wasting your time on. 5)Paying a small fee for towels6)The upstairs common area has a rougher/cumbersome layout. With all that being said, I got the impression there aren't a lot of super nice hostels in the Athens area. This could end up being one of the nicer ones despite the problems.","April 25, 2017","15    Athens Backpackers

882,"I stayed at this hostel 3 times over the course of 2 weeks solely because of its proximity to the subway lines. Being so close to Acropoli is actually the main selling point of this place. However I don't really think this hostel deserves as much praise as it gets. Mostly because the way they do their pricing is very unpleasant. If you don't book your rooms online then prepare to get a ridiculous rate. But the the thing is, I extended my stay 3 times all on Sundays and got a different price every time. It basically boils down to how nice the person at reception is feeling. The first time I did it I got a rate of €14 because I told them I was going to leave unless it was a good price so I assume they gave me the cheapest available rate to get me to stay. The second Sunday I did it they gave me a room rate of €17.50 and this was asking for a lower price because they initially said it was €19 before I asked them for a cheaper room. I could literally see on their computer screen there were tons of empty beds at the €14 rate but because she didn't want to do the work of changing rooms for me I had to pay the difference. Seriously, charging your guests extra so they convenience You instead of Me is a really big insult. This just led me to extend my stay on the third Sunday online and avoid the reception altogether so I was guaranteed the best price. Facilities are pretty basic for what you're paying for… you'd expect at €20 per night that you'd at least get an ensure bathroom but that's not the case. Be prepared to get your socks wet as well because a single shower will turn the floors into a lake. The kitchen facilities are respectable at least, and wifi is decent outside of the lounge which gets slow quite often for some reason. There's also a roof terrace which is useful for sunny days but the third day in a row they denied us access to the key because ""we go up there too often"". This hostel has weird ways of doing things it's truly like a bipolar environment when it comes to anything. Breakfast is always the same just a hard boiled egg with bread and vegetables. There's also a computer you can pay to use and printing something costs 10 cents per page which is kinda silly because plenty hostels will just let you print something for free and I only have to pay €11 per night for those ones. But anyways, the one thing I do really appreciate about Athens Backpackers is how easy it is to make new friends and meet people here. This isn't giving the actual place praise though because that totally depends on the type of guests here. If you want to stay here book online every time so you get the best rates because the staff are only helpful when it comes to questions about travel otherwise they're there to nickel and dime you!","December 21, 2016","15    Athens Backpackers

891,"Check in was easy - though I accidentally turned up to the studios rather than the backpackers, the lady there easily redirected me around the corner. Location was actually fantastic, only a few minutes (barely even that) to the entrance of both the Acropolis (secondary entrance) and the Acropolis museum.Room wasn't anything particularly special, only had I think four/five outlets for six people - not ideal. Shower was fine (though no towel provided!) but lack of a bathmat meant the floor in there was basically always wet. Lockers not quite big enough to fit my bag but plenty big to fit all your important things - you'll need your own lock.Breakfast was tasty but simple (tomato, cucumber, hard boiled egg and bread with oil) with tea and coffee available but almost didn't make it down for the 9:30 AM end time a few days - so early! I also went on the walking tour and despite high hopes it was a bit of a let down. First, it was not free, as I'd expected, especially since our tour guide introduced himself as not legally qualified to run tours. Soon after, we climbed a monstrous hill to follow our guide through a hole in the fence above the Panathenaic Stadium - I'm all for seeing the sights, but I really did think it was going to be legally! We got around to a few different locations in the end, but not without our guide sitting us down to basically lecture at us for at least 20-30 minutes in a few locations. He was hardly focused on just the history too - in the last (very uncomfortable) location, he and one of the people on the tour got into an argument about technology; neither showed any signs of stopping until they were finally cut off by reminding them both that this was supposed to be a tour, not a philosophical debate. Overall - would really not recommend the walking tour, take a different one.The rooftop bar at the backpackers was amazing though - fantastic view of the Acropolis and cheap drinks, made it really easy to meet other backpackers.Overall thoughts on the hostel - great location, good bar, okay rooms and breakfast, not great walking tour.","October 9, 2016","15    Athens Backpackers

Athens backpackers seemed to have a great location.After booking i received an e-mail with instructions how to find the hostel in different way of transport, it was very helpful, it was easy to find it this way. Walking distance from the airport bus-stop.The room was clean, the bedsheets too which is not always the case in hostels, the bathroom was ok as well, a lot better than the average. There were only 3 plugs in the room for 6 of us, but we managed pretty well.The location is very good, close to all the main sights: Acropolis, Zeus Temple, Roman Bath, Plaka, etc.The breakfast was the same every day: 2 hard boiled-eggs, some bread, some tomato and cucumber. Not the best. And i didn't have a clean feeling in the kitchen. That was the worst part of it for me.And the best was definately the roof-top bar with Acropolis-view. Magical! They have happy hours every day from 7-8 pm, which is a great opportunity to socialize. You can meet fantastic people from all over the World who you can go out for dinner, or drinks with, or go for sightseeing the next day.The staff is very nice and friendly too!I've had a great time there, thank you!Ps: the pictures were taken with my phone that's why the bad quality ","September 18, 2016","15    Athens Backpackers

Paid the tax difference up front and they gave us an overview to the room ( lights, keys and all) and they left us alone the whole duration of our stay. Do asked them anything you want- as far a good restaurant, where to go and where not to go and they will tell you. We didn’t have breakfast since we have a early morning excursions. No worries they have a lot of cafe nearby and Everbest( kind of seven eleven for us since it’s everywhere just like in the USA but just all food and coffee with fresh bakery no grocery store) Rooms: It Is basic and clean with all the necessities needed (safety box, in room refrigerator and they give you new bedroom slippers). I just have an issue with the shower curtains- it’s to short that the water goes out and makes the floor in restroom all wet when showering. We were in the 6 floor and we can still hear the people partying and they stay out late! But no worries just close all the window and you won’t hear them. Air condition works really good, I appreciate it a lot since they are having summer weather already. They do have Iron but you need to have the reception sent it to your room or you pick it up. Either way you just have to return it after use.Location: The Best Part!! -40 mints from the airport ( we arranged a car service so I am not sure it the hotel does airport pick up) but you can asked them to get you a cab in the most rediculous times for airport drop off and they will still do it for you- just let them know ahead of time. I know this because we did it at 3:30 am to catch a flight to Santorini. Also know that the charges for evening/dawn pick up is more than the morning/mid day pick up. No Uber or Lyft in Athens or anywhere in Greece.  It’s a 10 min walk from the Acropolis and most of the Tourist attractions and good restaurants. The neighborhood is not very appealing since it is located in a business area but it seem safe. We followed our Car services advice- Just don’t go Left from your hotel.

After a full day and a great dinner - location away from some attractions but close to the Plaka district and great outdoor restaurants. Not sure you can go wrong - scout the menu and get a feel for the atmosphere. For some reason every restaurant we went to in Athens gave us either an unrequested free dessert (amazing) or liquors to end our meal (equally amazing). Back to hotel on the subject of amazing. The view of the Acropolis from the roof is worth the price of admission. Wait until dark and then just enjoy. We actually did our own walking tour the next day and it was disappointing close up so we might suggest the tour first and the night sky later.

This was very convenient since that was our main way of getting around the city and there were many wonderful restaurant options at Monastiraki Square. There is a lot of graffiti in this area which made me feel slightly uneasy but as the day went on, I became more comfortable in the area. It seemed rather safe though there is quite a few homeless people on the streets asking for money, which I guess is typical in a city area. Rooms: The room was plain and simple. We were on the first floor with no views and there were no decorations in our room. The bed was very comfortable and the AC worked well. The bathroom was slightly small but exactly what anyone would need. The shower had good pressure and heated water. I did not hear any noise where my room was located.

Very helpful!I stayed in three different rooms, all quite similar in size and amenities. Even though I was traveling solo, I think that two people could have stayed in the room without too much trouble. Everything worked well in the room, though it took a couple of days' practice to keep the bathroom floor relatively dry when I used the small shower.It's possible to include breakfast in the room rate, which I did. The breakfast is OK, with plenty of choices, but my desire for freshly squeezed orange juice eventually drove me to eat at the excellent Beneth cafe/bakery next door.The roof bar is open until midnight and offers a spectacular view of the Parthenon on the Acropolis. I discovered a laundromat about 3 blocks away, close to Monastaraki, where you can do your own wash or have the attendant do it overnight. That came in handy. There is also an excellent market for fruits and veggies about three blocks north (away from Monastaraki toward Omonia).As you walk along Athinas Street and around the neighborhood, you can see some effects of Greece's decade of economic crisis. There are some homeless people on the sidewalk and lots of graffiti, unfortunate but not dangerous.Would I stay at the Attalos again? Absolutely. It's a good value in an excellent location with a helpful staff.","May 5, 2019","16    Attalos Hotel

925,"We stayed here for 4 nights in the spring of 2018. It was very good. As we were getting to the hotel by car in the middle of the night, we could see the beautiful backlighted Acropolis from the avenue. It was a nice introduction to the city and to the country itself. The hotel is very well located, close to the main points of Athens, some few meters from Monastiraki. You have to pay attention to get there on foot, as the entrance is not very large and it can be unnoticed as you pass by. Good location for the night and the day. The rooms are simple, but clean and comfortable. The breakfast is very good and well prepared, but we paid it apart from the daily rates and it was not very expensive. We've got a discounted rate, as we booked far in advance and in their website. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is conveniently located and the taxi company they recommended for an aiport transfer were friendly and efficient - no arguing about the fare and such other nonsense.

940,"Stayed in a double room with balcony (which, btw, had a pretty awesome view of the Acropolis). Bathroom was smallish but recently renovated with all new fixtures and tiling. Room was quiet at night and we did not hear any noise from the street below. Enjoyed the plentiful breakfast options (included) and wifi connection was flawless. Location is good; heading towards Monastiraki the area felt very safe; heading in the opposite direction perhaps a little less so. Police station is directly across the street so I certainly felt it was a good sign. Staff very very friendly and helpful and there are lots of restaurants and grocers in the immediate area. The hotel has rooftop terrace with a bar (not really any meal service). TIP: If arriving from the airport, the hotel does offer to arrange a taxi for you for a few extra Euro. We didn’t take advantage of the hotels offer on arrival in Athens and experienced an incredibly reckless taxi ride in from the airport. Paid the extra Euro when we were leaving and was extremely happy with the professional driver, spotless taxi and informative conversation.","November 9, 2018","16    Attalos Hotel

So much so that we could go out in the morning, explore and come back in the afternoon to rest when the sun was very hot, and head back out. There's a supermarket just opposite (about 1 min walk) and plenty of eateries nearby. We opted for breakfast with the room and had no regrets! We're vegetarians but had plenty of options to choose from - dried and fresh fruit, spinach and cheese pies, croissants, Greek yoghurt, cereals, coffee, tea and juices. Rooms were small but clean and staff were friendly and helpful. There's an open area on one of the floors where you have access to computers with internet and printers.

It is a little smart phone loaded with internet, google maps and sightseeing things to do all free and at the click of a button! We took our travel buddy with us when we went exploring and thought it was absolutely fantastic especially since we hadn’t purchased SIM cards yet! The staff are there to go above and beyond in getting you to make the most of you stay! There is a staff member who greets you at breakfast and offers to help you organise your day and helps you with any questions you may have and offers some fantastic advice! Highly recommend the Plaka hotel for anyone coming to Athens!","June 20, 2019","17    Plaka Hotel

964,I really loved the charm of this small hotel in the Plaka district. They gave me a small bottle of wine and cold water when I checked in which was very welcome. I have never had to use a hotel's laundry service before but it was done the next day and everything smelled very nice. It was 9 euro for as much as you can stuff in a bag both wash and dry. The rooftop bar is so much fun! I went up there in the morning and at night and it is a very comfortable spot with outdoor couches. The bar is open from 5pm to 11pm. The breakfast has TONS of variety both savory and sweet and I enjoyed it very much. You are just one or two streets over from Adrianou shopping street. I was upgraded to an Acropolis view room.,"June 9, 2019","17    Plaka Hotel

We also took a trip up to the rooftop and it is such a spectacular unobstructed view of the Acropolis!The room was a lovely size and very comfortable. There is a small market next door and a supermarket opposite so very handy for getting any items needed for the room. There are plenty of options at breakfast.

We were super jet lagged and frustrated and the front reception was so incredibly helpful to us. We ended up having to stay one more day in Athens to get a passport and the hotel was able to arrange for one more last minute night stay and even was able to keep us in the same room so we didn’t have to move all our luggage. This was a huge relief to a stressful situation and we were able to enjoy Athens. The rooms are basic but very comfortable. Water from the shower got everywhere and one day after the cleaning crew had been there I no longer had a shaving razor. So that was weird haha.

The bathroom was modern. We were in room 202 and it had a small balcony with a side view of the Acropolis. The beds were comfortable. Breakfast was fabulous - lots of breads, cakes, fruit and yoghurt. Tea and coffee available all day. The staff were incredibly friendly, and even allowed us to keep our room for an extra hour on our last day to await our transfer car. They also arranged for early breakfast on the Sunday morning for the marathon runners. Location is perfect. Near lots of restaurants and 'proper' shops but also very close to tourist shops and bars. There was not much noise (some building works early from next door but only on the Saturday and from about 8am which wasn't too bad). We walked everywhere because the hotel is so centrally located, but it's also near some main metro stations if you need to use them. Athens is beautiful. And the Plaka hotel would be a great choice for your stay. The view from the roof is breathtaking. One thing, our bathroom flooded the first time we used the shower. Didn't the next couple of times so unsure why this was. The showers are cubicles just placed on the floor in the corner of the bathroom, so may just need resealing.

It was fantastic that the breakfast room was open throughout the day for free coffee/hot chocolate and cookies. Our room had a very comfortable bed. Our room was small, but didn't feel crowded. The bathroom only had a shower, but it was a large and comfortable size. Water pressure was the best we experienced during our trip. The staff was hit or miss. Some of the staff acted like we were inconveniencing them by asking simple questions and were very curt with answers. However, others were fantastically helpful and would follow up the next day to see how we'd liked the events we asked for help with. I would definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to Athens, as the rooftop view was the best I saw in Athens.","November 18, 2018","17    Plaka Hotel

Plaka is right at the foot of the Acropolis and is easy walking to anywhere. The hotel room was very clean and a joy to stay in. We had the Acropolis view right from our hotel window - it was amazing! There is a rooftop lounge/bar where you can sit, relax and enjoy the amazing view. Every morning you are treated to a huge breakfast buffet with everything that you could want - from eggs, bacon, sausage, and breads to yogurt, fruit, and juices. And I can't say enough about the hotel staff, everyone was so friendly and helpful. The cleaning staff greeted us each morning when we saw them, the kitchen staff was friendly.

The mini bar consisted of 2 small bottles of water but only on the first day.

They even arranged for a taxi to take us to the port and since it was early, they packed up a breakfast for us to take with us! This hotel felt so much more welcoming and friendly than the generic stay you would get at a chain hotel. If you want a more special memory of where you stay in Athens, pick here.

The rooms were excellent as well! They were very roomy and modern. My family and I booked a room for three and we never once felt smushed together. Also, I cannot gush enough about the food. The complementary breakfasts were better than some of the restaurant breakfasts we had and the mini croissants were to DIE for! The location was great as well. About 15 minutes to the base of the Acropolis, 10 minutes to the Temple of Zeus, and about 7 minutes to the historic Plaka Area (all walking). Honestly, there is nothing bad I could say about this hotel. It fit our needs perfectly and my family and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in the central part of Athens but doesn't want to break their wallet to do so. 10/10 would stay at In(n)Athens again.","June 30, 2019","18    InnAthens

1013,"Pros: location is great for central Athens, just right the corner of Syntagma Sq and the metro; the courtyard is great for breakfast, work and lounging; buffet breakfast is varied and plenfiful - no hot dishes, but enough other things to choose from, including fresh fruit, AND you can ask the staff for a proper bar espresso (i.e. you don't have to drink the watered down filter coffee from the counter); 24hr reception (which is great when your late ferry is 3hrs late); good wifi.Cons: I am a light sleeper; our windows (possibly all rooms do?) opened onto the courtyard mentioned above and unfortunately I was awoken both nights by people talking and laughing there at various night hours. Closing the windows and turning the A/C on helps only up to a point, so I'm guessing the windows aren't fully soundproof, and so I needed earplugs. However, traffic is not audible at night.Other: we stayed in a suite for 2,5 nights (given our v. late arrival). It was spacious, but somewhat bare (furniture at a minimum, no decor) and not exactly uninviting, although the Nespresso machine was a plus. As I had to work while my husband was at a conference, I prefered to do so in the courtyard. I was surprised by lack of room service on day one, but attributed that to our later than planned arrival. The room was cleaned after that, although I noticed the bottles of water in the minibar weren't replaced (tap water in Athens is drinkable, but it's not exactly tasty). However, all the staff members we had direct contact with (receptionists x 2, bar/restaurant staff) were helpful and friendly. I might stay in this place again if I needed something functional for central Athens, but not for the atmosphere.","June 21, 2019","18    InnAthens

Rooms facing the city have absolutely no soundproofing. You might as well be sleeping on the balcony because you can hear all the traffic. If you're a city lover and use to it, this won't be a problem.2. The night we decided to stay, they restaurant across the street decided to have an open air concert from 10 PM until 1 AM ON A WEDNESDAY! You can hear every word and every note...so forget sleep.

The courtyard is a nice place to wind down after a day's walking within the city. Can be a bit noisy in the morning with breakfast diners though as the windows are not very good in insulating the noise. Would imagine it would be worse if you're facing the road.Breakfast is very good and you can order your breakfast from an ala-carte menu or have the ready made pastries, the latter I must say is above average.

1021,"As we'd booked a 'de-luxe' room I was expecting something a bit special. True, the bedroom looked quite stylish, but it lacked practicality. Firstly the only flat surface on which to place anything was a tiny triangular area in a corner. There were no drawers, no comfortable chair and, surprisingly, no mirror. The only mirror was in the bathroom with a hairdryer fixed to the wall next to it. It meant my wife and I had to take turns for drying hair, make-up, shaving etc. No space in the bathroom to store dry towels and no rails on which to hang used ones to dry for re-use. The wash basin, a strange assembly of marble off-cuts had a marble slab in the bottom supported on stone nibs, which meant no plug. Washing/shaving had to be done under running water, rather wasteful. On the plus side, the air-con was both silent and very effective, two features which don't necessarily come together.Breakfast was perfectly adequate but nothing special.

The rooms are a decent size and very clean, and there is a complementary buffet breakfast each morning that has a nice selection. It was very easy to walk anywhere we needed once we were there (just 15 mins to Acropolis) and lots to do and see in the neighborhood. However, the reason my review comes down in stars is because of the rudeness of the hotel staff. Nearly every person we interacted with was rude and cold and not hospitable at all. We had one incident in particular where my spouse had ordered something for breakfast that never came. Instead of the server owning up to the fact that he forgot to put the order in, he stood by silently while another server berated my spouse for expecting his food to be ready immediately. The quality of service was very poor, and so even though the hotel is otherwise very nice, I cannot fully recommend staying here.","May 5, 2019","18    InnAthens

We found another hotel, and decided to stay two nights there instead of having to move yet again on Saturday. We were told that, since we gave 46 hours notice instead of 48 hours, we would be charged $40. This didn’t feel fair, since they had ample time to rent the room. When I spoke to the same female desk clerk about our situation, she was very rude, asked me for my card, and charged us $40. So the hotel rented the room and took $40 off us.

The service was AMAZING, great location to all restaurants, shops and various sights. We walked everywhere, including a visit to Agora and Syntagma Square, where we watched the Changing of the Guard and the Acropolis . Breakfast was beyond delicious-freshly cooked to order and so many choices. The rooms were clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The staff was always helpful too!

1038,"This is a great choice of hotel for a stay in central Athens. The location is fantastic; a modest walk to most things, and, considering how central it is, extremely quiet. The rooms are clean (and for anyone like me who is bothered by these things, the room smelt nice the moment we walked in), modern and comfortable. They are thoughtfully equipped, for example two types of pillows, one feather, one graduated foam so you can get it just right. The shower was spacious and the jet strong and hot. Nice to see that the staff enforce, very politely, the no smoking in rooms policy - hurrah! Breakfast is included and is generous and varied, and there is a light bites menu available through the day until 11pm. We found this very helpful, arriving on a late evening flight and not wanting to go too far to get a small supper. We sat in the courtyard under the lemon tree and the stars and enjoyed a simple meal there. The courtyard proved to be an inner sanctuary a couple of times; when en route from A to B we just popped back in for a drink and a rest. The staff at InnAthens are excellent - friendly, extremely helpful and very efficient, both during our stay, and indeed in all communications before our arrival. We knew we wanted to book a day trip with a private driver to Delphi and InnAthens kindly arranged everything for us with Opa Tours. Stamatios, our expert driver, was everything you could want - punctual, reliable, so knowledgeable and great company. The ethos at Opa Tours is something special. Yes, highly professional, but beyond that, the company and its staff are truly focussed on providing outstanding customer service. Relationships matter above all, and nothing is too much trouble. Stamatios went above and beyond in everything he did, out of ‘philotomo’, a Greek concept for which there is no easy translation but which here perhaps equates to something like taking a ‘personal pride’ in what you do, doing the best job you can, not least out of self respect. As a result we had the best experience and promptly did a second tour with Stamatios, again arranged through InnAthens, to Sounio and the Temple of Poseidon. What a superb recommendation from the brilliant team at InnAthens! All in all a great stay. Thank you!","March 13, 2019","18    InnAthens

1039,"So, the hotel is located in a perfect area full of great restaurants and bars,and you can reach all the attractions and must see places by foot.Even the bar restaurant at the entrance of the hotel has very good food and drinks. The only little inconvinience is that if you get a room that faces the street it can be very loud.They should probably invest in better windows with a very good isolation system. Athens is a crazy loud city. But a wonderful one,one of my favourites in the world. Nearly as much or even more than Berlin or Barcelona.That is the only negative point of this hotel.(Windows) Beds are super comfortable, rooms are big enough and showers are great.The breakfast is great,something very important for me too.All in all","February 22, 2019","18    InnAthens

1048,"We had a beautiful stay at InnAthens. It was very easy to get to from the subway, walking distance to all the things you must see and do and the staff was so helpful.First location is the key! It was easy to get to from any location. It was tucked away behind a very nice wine bar that sits right in front of a beautiful old church. The hotel has a very nice patio garden to sit in the evening and have breakfast in the morning or a cocktail in the evening. We stayed in another hotel 10 days later in the middle of town and it was extremely noisy so you will appreciate the quite atmosphere during the day and evening at InnAthens.Second the staff...all very friendly and on hand 24/7. They are able to give directions and order a taxi if needed at anytime. Third Breakfast was amazing! It was a great way to start the day and kept us satisfired throughout the day. Anything you want is available and you can also order off the menu.Forth is the room. I saved for last only because of our room location we were unable to see any of the other rooms and the locations We apparently had the family room. It was large and roomy but I have a few complaints about the room. One it was below ground level and windows faced the patio. It was also right next to the reception desk with a glass door separating the reception area and the door to the room. It was a little awkward to come out of room and have the office right outside your room in a glass box. It just didn't feel like we had a lot of privacy. If you wanted the curtains open in the room people walking by or on the patio can look right down in your room. I believe the room we stayed in is the only room laid out like this. The other problem was the outlet in our bathroom did not work. We complained but they said it was 110volt and only worked for a electric razor when in fact the outlet itself said 320 volt and a curling iron is the same volts as a electric razor. We did not argue with them we just tried to make it work with our curling irons plugged in the room with no mirror. We used the glass door as a mirror. There was a mirror inside a closet door but the available outlet was too far away to curl your hair. Maybe it's fixed by now. One minor thing it's also really dark in the bathroom.Over all we loved our stay and the location. I would definitely recommend this Boutique hotel. It was quite and location and staff great!

1054,"Pros: LOCATION, breakfast, LOCATION, staff, LOCATIONCons: None.It's been a long time since I've raved about a hotel. I mean, you're paying the price, so what's there to rave about when your expectations are met? However, I have lots to rave about InnAthens. First and foremost, it is SUCH bang for buck. I'm so amazed at how reasonably priced this place is for where it is located... In the heart of the city, walking distance to many of the major attractions.We will begin with how it's snuggled inside and behind a bar, courtyard, and lemon tree. In spite of being in such a central location, it's still very quiet because it's off of a side street and nestled in between a few other establishments. Very friendly, professional, and helpful staff greet you in the lobby and offer you a beverage. (I had my first coffee in Greece here.)The decor is modern, chic, and minimal. Everything is clean and functional. The bed was comfortable, the pillows didn't smell funky, and the room came with a cute little balcony, equipped with chairs and a small table. Wifi is accessible inside the rooms, and the A/C cools right away upon starting. I have no complaints. (Oh, some water seeped out from under the shower door, but this was not much of an issue.)Breakfast (which is included with your stay) is DELICIOUS. There's a variety of options for your caffeine intake (from espresso, cappuccino to Americano) and a good selection of pastries. I recommend the chocolate-filled croissants. There's also fresh fruits, freshly-squeezed orange juice, and different cereals to choose from. Oh, and if none of that is to your liking, you can choose from a menu and have something hot freshly whipped up from the kitchen. Thumbs up!InnAthens is a short walk into Syntagma Square. We also walked to the Acropolis from the hotel (about 10 minutes). You're also literally across the street from the National Park. I can't stress how central the location is. You're close to endless restaurants (all highly rated on TripAdvisor) and shopping streets. If nothing else, pick InnAthens for its prime location and accessibility to everything.Tips: Grab a SIM card from Vodaphone (a short walk from InnAthens) for the month. It includes local minutes and data for a very reasonable price. (I paid 15 euros.) There's no contract and they automatically cancel your card after the month is up. If needed, you can purchase top-ups within the month.","September 1, 2018","18    InnAthens

The well appointed rooms encircle a lovely peaceful courtyard, which is hermetically sealed by a large glass door from the noise and busy Plaka streets outside.We stayed in a suite, where our bed was incredibly comfortable, even the sofa bed that our daughter slept on.Breakfast was delicious with so many really great vegetarian options on the menu (which is very unusual in Greece!).

The location could not be better as you’re close to all of the major historical sites, amazing restaurants, and touristy shopping.

This was a nice room, but we did not have a balcony or a view of the mountain as the buildings across the street were in our way. We did have roof access, and there was an awesome view from here. My only issues with this room, was that the stairs to go to the roof went through the room. When one of the other 2 rooms with access went up there it was very loud in our room. We also were woken up a lot with people on the lower floors trying to access the roof (we think they thought the rooftop bar was there). Perhaps a sign on the door would prevent the constant beeps it was our experience that everyone with a keycard would try about 3 times before giving up. Room was cleaned daily this was satisfactory.

That set up is several blocks away and again nothing like the pictures. But really don't need it you're 3 blocks from the Acropolis for Gods sakes. The hotel is clean ish. The heat works fine. There's ongoing remodeling construction in the hotel. So it can be very noisy late into the evening 10 and 11pm. The front desk is super nice if it's Walter, otherwise it's catch-as-catch-can. There are plenty of taxis driving by for the €38 trip to the airport. Do not let the front desk book your taxi, they up charge you for the convenience of them calling their taxi. You don't need it. The restaurant across the street is really really good. You can tell, it's packed all the time. Excellent food. Order the large beans with onion garlic Olive oil. Fried anchovy -- yes anchovy -- it's nothing like the anchovies you're thinking of. These are delicious. The Greek salads fabulous and the staff super nice.","April 22, 2019","19    Athens Studios

1070,"We arrived to hotel around 6 pm on March 22 for two night stay, when we arrived to hotel, the girl at front desk was not smiling at all, we were exited for arriving to Athens for the first time, so we went to see the view from room as our booking was done back in Sept 30, 2018, when we go to the room, we did not had the view of the Acropolis because they gave us room 20 that has not view to acropolis, I went back to the girl and told her, and she told me wait, she went back to a door and spoke to someone and she told me you have room access and I told her no, that is not the room, so she said yes that is your room, I have no way to contact booking.com I could not made calls out or my company will charge me, so I said I will wait until I go back to USA, then the room was 4 adults in that small room, they did not wanted to help me at all. room 21 was the room that I was suppose to get in Penthouse both (20 & 21) and a door to roof access for room 20. (see first pic with one full bed and a two sofa beds, then rest was the room I received on my last night on March 27 room 21, more spacious and bigger with two terrace and acropolis view.I spoke on March 29 with Booking.com and after 5 days the resolution was, they believe the manager from hotel even though I had proof of my emails saying it was acropolis view not ROOF ACCESS room. and booking.com refund me only 29 euros.I will never get a reservation thru Booking.com because they do not help you or back you up event with proof in your hands. MIND YOU: Property did not wanted to help me with nothing in compensation due to their mistake in their part for giving me the wrong room. (see email proof that I booked Acropolis views since Sept 2018.Also the breakfast for this hotel is really suck, it outside the hotel and cold when it gets to your table.

1071,"Overall, the apartment was spacious, modern and very good as was the staff, service, price & location of Athens Studios. We had Room 22 on 5th floor - very good view. As one enters there was a sitting/lounging area, then a small efficiency kitchen section, then sleeping area with a king size bed. The tiny bathroom was off to the side which unfortunately could have used a few more inches & been better planned (at 200 lbs I could barely fit on commode as I was wedged between wall & metal rack under sink). Shower had one totally open end & no tray for soap/shampoo. Also, there was no clothes closet or hangers in the apartment. Still, the room, overall, was very nice & came with a very good complimentary hot breakfast. We would stay again..","March 16, 2019","19    Athens Studios

1073,"Visited recently with my wife and friends recently for a city break. We were exceptionally pleased with the apartments and the location couldn’t have been better. The Acropolis site, museums and many other tourist attractions were easily accessible on foot from the apartments (Athens Studios) and found a small but excellent Greek restaurant just opposite the main entrance serving qood quality Greek food. The restaurant was always full of locals which was a good sign and prices were reasonable for the city centre. We all said we wouldn’t hesitate to return to the apartments and found the prices paid were reasonable. My wife and I paid €228 for 4 nights in a large apartment with 2 balconies including breakfast and our friends paid about €150 for a smaller 1 bedroom apartment with 1 balcony which was I would book next time.Breakfast was basic but not unacceptable. The coffee was the only thing we couldn’t tolerate as it was just warm and glad we took our own sachets of instant coffee which was much better using the hot water provided to make your own tea. I have attached a few photographs but not taken any of the separate bedroom which was spacious with a wardrobe.","February 18, 2019","19    Athens Studios

1074,"Office help was always ready to assist in any way. The laundromat was next door. So to was a bar with delicious food which served liquor. The room was relatively quiet in spite of the fact that we were there during a weekend. But I understand it could sometimes get loud, in which case you just went down and joined the party. At 11 o'clock they closed the doors to reduce noise and traffic. The rooms and the kitchen were clean; the contained toiletries and a few dishes. The stove had two burners and there was a small fridge underneath the counter. The first night was pretty bad because my husband snores and we were in one room. We went to the office for help and they gave us two rooms which allowed me to sleep and they didn't charge extra!!! What it lacked in beauty, it gave in comfort, and availability to all main attractions. Beds were single in both rooms; one room had four bunkbeds. I would rather have had a nicer looking room but I'm happy to have stayed there for its easiness to access. The breakfast which came with the room was fairly ok, but the guy behind the counter kept burning the omelets and at one point when I got there they were actually cold. But the hamburger and fries next door at the bar were absolutely delicious.","December 27, 2018","19    Athens Studios

1079,"If you are not picky and location is all that matters - you can stay at Athens studios. We were a group with 4 rooms staying for five days, and in 2 of the rooms there were bed bugs. One person in our group got a very bad rash from this, and the pharmacy were not in doubt about what was the reason. However the staff at the hotel was more interested in blaming us and coming with excuses than actually helping us. They also spoke about us in greek in front of us, too bad they didnt know that one person in our group understood greek. Really unprofessional and rude! The receptionist was also rude and argued with us instead of being nice and understanding of our situation. It cost us a lot of time and energi as we had to clean all of our clothes and luggage. It also cost us money as we had to buy new luggage.The hotel (would rather call it hostel) was fully booked so we couldnt get a new room. The staff removed the bugs and wiped the floors. The cleaning of the hotel is no more than okay. The rooms are dusty and some areas looks mouldy. The toliet in one of the rooms broke down, and as there were no availble rooms we just had to live with that. The day after we got a new room (one day before departure). So, the good things about this place is obviously its location. The breakfast is okay, and the rooms are okay (except the bugs and dust ofc). All in all bugs are obviously a huge negative factor about this place. However the impression could be better with more serviceminded staff. The attitude of several of them were unprofessional and despicable and that is also reflected in the way they answer some of the reviews here at tripadvisor. We felt like we were bothering the staff, and thats a weird feeling when you pay a lot of money to stay somewhere and the staff are suppose to be at your service. It is also destructive for the rest of the staff that is actually trying to do their job. Two tip: ATTITUDE and CLEANESS.","November 6, 2018","19    Athens Studios

1080,"We stayed here for 4 nights with our two kids (9 and 4 years). The location is excellent with a few mins walk to the Acropolis and Plaka. There is also many restaurants, launderette, mini marts etc within easy reach. The studio was large, bright and clean. Ours had a queen bed and 2 more foldable beds, small kitchenette and dining table. Ideal for family travel. The toilet was small, basic and could have done with a proper shower cubicle - instead of an open plan which results in the entire floor getting wet. While free wifi was available, it was slow, weak and had a cumbersome process to access it. With all of us carrying multiple devices, this is not ideal.","October 24, 2018","19    Athens Studios

1081,"Firstly, the accommodation facility is spread across at least 4 apartment blocks in various stages of decay, you can't walk between them, nothing like the pictures. The advertised roof top bar, is actually elsewhere. I asked reception and got a vague wave of the hand indicating down the street somewhere. The lift to our room was only large enough for 1 person, plus a backpack, seriously, no exaggeration. The ""Apartments"" weren't very clean, everything saturated in cigarette smoke, so I suppose it wouldn't be a problem for smokers. The shower was tiny and kept flooding, the front door wouldnt lock properly, powerpoints were loose, just generally a dilapidated room. And the ""apartment "" had no iron or ironing board. The breakfast was super basic and if the bread ran out, it wasn't replenished, so tough luck. One time, I pointed the empty bread basket to staff and was laughed at. Location is quite good, heaps of other places to stay nearby, you may want to give this one a miss. ","October 21, 2018","19    Athens Studios

1082,"My reservation here needed to be changed by 1 week and after working with hotels.com who tried multiple times to work it out and a lengthy email exchange from me with the manager, it was finally sorted. When I arrived for my new dates, they had been entered wrong (hotels.com's fault?) and I was told there were no beds but they could send me to Athens Backpackers hostel where I had to 12 euro to ""sleep"" on a disgusting common area couch. There also don't seem to be any quiet hours as people were up and music playing all night. The bathrooms were disgusting as well and the next morning I asked for my 24 euros back so I could go somewhere else (I paid another 24 when I ""checked in"" to stay in a dorm for a night). They even told me that I hadn't paid 24 euros even though I had a receipt. I had also already paid through hotels.com so now I have paid twice! They refused to give me my money back and instead I had to upgrade to a studio to get out of there (which meant more money). The studio was fine - it wasn't worth 65 euros. It seems Athens Studios cares more about making money than the comfort of customers and they certainly aren't concerned with doing the right thing for their customers. I have now paid them twice and left two notes for the manager who mysteriously was never around on my visit (even though I was told she would be). I asked her to contact me about refunding some of the money that they made me pay in cash when I arrived. I left my phone number and my email address (even though they already have both) and I've never heard from her. This place is not worth it and they seem to lie about information when asked. I'm very disappointed. The only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 is because of the location. It is very close to all of the main tourist attractions.","October 18, 2018","19    Athens Studios

It seemed a bit pricey to us for what we got, but, it is in a very very good location in terms of being right next to the Acropolis Museum/Acropolis, etc. So, I guess that it why it is a bit expensive. Just remember, in terms of one man's trash and another's treasure: it is also very very loud. This is not really the fault of the place but the location. But, it seemed to go for the worst of both worlds: crying babies inside the hotel, and incessent throbbing bass and music and partying outside. One night I had the very first white night of my entire life, which did make sightseeing the next day less than fun. I would advise for those older than, say, 35 who are not singles, to research a place that is quieter. I didn't know present-day Athens all that well when I was making my plans but having been, I would go a bit further out. The metro in Athens is sparkling, lovely, so modern from a U.S. perspective. So, you could be one or two metro stops away from the Acropolis stop and still have a wonderful time. Unless you are looking for the bar scene, I'd advise another place!Also, technically there is a roof deck at the other facility, but, it was all young people and all alcohol fueled.

Its name describes exactly the case as it's not a hotel (although there is a very friendly and helpful 24hrs reception) but rather a set of beautiful, clean and equipped studios right in the ""heart"" of the city. Each studio is fully A/C and it has bedroom(s), private bathroom, kitchen and a small living room with TV. You can have breakfast at the ""Fish-Cafe"" next to the Reception and we were given complimentary ""ouzo"" drinks at the nearby bar. But the best thing is the LOCATION. Although it could be a bit noisy (in lower floors), it's literally just a 3 min walk from both the magnificent Acropolis Museum and the metro station that will take you anywhere in the city. You can also use it as the starting (and finishing) point of an amazing walk around the Acropolis Hill and the historic center of Athens (Start early as it will take you the whole day).

The choice for breakfast is not much but complete including bread, eggs, cheese/tomate/ham and drinks. Each room has its own kitchen and bathroom; however, the photos on the site are a bit too ideal - the rooms are not that bright - which is fine. The bed is simple without personal plugs and curtain. At night, prob coz I sleep beside the window, I can hear the noise from their bar downstairs. It is a bit annoying but acceptable tinkling of the room rate.","February 22, 2018","19    Athens Studios

We stayed here for the second time (first in 2009). A six night stay was broken in to two stints. The first stint in room 14 = 5 stars. Second stint in room 11 was more like 31/2.

Anyway, for the disturb she said we could have one beer for free. We refused it, but didn’t have any choice and we negotiated a refund of 10%. Better than nothing, but moving after you settle really sucks, not worth the little refund I got back, if I could choose.The same girl, after I asked if there was a place still open to buy toothpaste, laugh at me like I was retarded and say that nothing is open at 10pm on Sunday. I thanked for the info, got out and there was a mini market open right beyond the corner where I found the toothpaste.Not that she had to know everything, but say “I’m sorry I don’t know” would have been much more appropriated.The day I checked out I got back to my room at 10:30 (checkout is at 11:00), the cleaners where outside and already removed the old sheets and blanket from my bed, they moved away my clothes and my towel disappeared. When I told them they said they put it in the laundry as they thought it belonged to the hostel. I haven’t seen any other brown towel, anyway after waiting a while I got it back.","November 1, 2017","19    Athens Studios

Kitchen counters were heavily worn, and the bathroom was so small I couldn't use the toilet without keeping my feet on the side of the shower. Bed was reasonably comfortable. The apartment was right over the sports bar on the first floor and so until the bar closed sleeping was problematic. I was there at the end of high season. The individual beds are inexpensive enough that perhaps the high season pricing works better, but the apartment cost enough (about 100 euro/night) that for a little bit more I'd go elsewhere.

Also, I was rudely barged in on around 10am while i was half naked changing to the cleaning staff who persisted asking me if i was leaving (I was not -until the next day - my roommate had just left) they did not leave so I had to ask them to leave so i could get dressed and they left for 10 seconds and then barged back in. My roommate had left his jersey and the cleaners just threw it in the rubbish instead of taking to the front desk in case he came back to claim it. The hostel did not provide any activities - all activities were organised through the adjacent hostel (which was the hostel I thought i had originally booked). The bathroom had no toilet paper and the shower was clogged so i had to stand in gross still water. This then overflowed and was not cleaned up by the next morning so I had to use my only towel (that i also paid for) to clean up the floor.

1145,"Stayed here with four friends in June 2016. Upon arriving staff we friendly and helpful, and as we initially went to Athens Backpackers - staff at both hostels were helpful in directing us to the correct hostel. We were expecting a bunk room but when we arrived we had been an apartment as they had space in the hotel - this was a lovely surprise. As a result we had a whole apartment to ourselves - this included a small en suite, a room with four bunk beds in and a large living room and kitchen dining room. This had a small kitchenette, fridge, dining table, sofa and a TV! There was even a balcony. The room was clean and spacious and perfect for our stay. The beds were comfortable and we had a nice little balcony to look out over Athens. Location wise we very close to the Acropolis that was about a 10 minute walk, as well as being very near restaurants, shops, cafes and museums. On our first night we simply walked down the street and ate in one of the first restaurants we went to - that happened to be recommended in the Lonely Planet's Guide to Athens and had very good reviews - however be careful the staff are very pushy and attempted to drag us into all the restaurants we went passed including this one. The hostel is also a 'sister' hostel to the Athens Backpackers. in the evenings we made the 2 minute walk to the other hostel a few streets away to use their rooftop bar - this had a great atmosphere and was a great way to meet new people. It also has an excellent view of the Acropolis which is great to see all lit up at night. The staff at the bar were also really friendly. The lady working behind the bar kept complimenting us and made lovely cocktails!There is also a sports bar next to this hostel that everyone went to after the rooftop bar closed. This bar although a little dingy was fun and also a great way to meet other travelers. Drinks were reasonable and the music was good (albeit sometimes a bit strange.) Breakfast was complimentary and you qued up at the fish bar in between the hostel and sports bar to get this. The food was okay and you were given eggs, bread, olives, feta and a small salad. But for the price you pay this was excellent!All in all we had a good stay at the hostel. It had a fun atmosphere and was full of young people from all over the world, with an excellent location and clean rooms what more can you ask!","January 15, 2017","19    Athens Studios

The best part is the location , It is near to Acropolis, Acropolis museum and Syntagma square. There are many cafes nearby. Metro station is just a 5 min walk .Staff is very helping .They also serve a very basic complimentary breakfast comprising of a 1 boiled egg, a bread , salad , feta cheese and 2 olives.overall it was a good stay .","January 4, 2017","19    Athens Studios

1147,"We arrived on a day when the tiny lift had just been repaired. We were told it was operational and I got in with 2 cases - the door shut and it didn't move- nor did the door open again. There was no emergency button and no phone so I just screamed until someone opened it from the outside. We then proceeded to carry our heavy luggage up 4 flights of stairs (72 steps) to our apartment and we used those stairs for the entire length of our stay just be to safe. On entering our spacious unit we found that management had removed all the a/c remote controls ""because it was November"".- just not good enough when its still so warm in Athens this year. On check in we were given lots of verbal information but nothing written about breakfast hours and unfortunately we missed the cut off by 25 minutes. On a positive- the beds were comfortable, the apartment was clean and we loved our huge private balcony.","November 8, 2016","19    Athens Studios

1156,We had a wonderful experience at the Acropolis Stay Hotel. Originally we booked this hotel because it was very affordable and had great reviews and were blown away by how clean and modern it was. When we first checked in we were greeted and told to help ourselves to a shot of traditional liquor (our first time trying Ouzo). We had a pretty rough travel into town since our flight was delayed and wanted to the ground running. Literally this place is STEPS away from the south entrance of the acropolis (definitely recommend using that entrance instead of the main one) steps away from Plaka (with all the little stores). It was the perfect home base. We stayed here for two nights and it was incredibly comfortable and had an excellent location. Highly recommend!,"May 30, 2019","20    Acropolis Stay

1160,"Our first night here, a Saturday night after a red eye flight from the US the previous night when we were all badly in need of sleep, we were kept awake from 9pm until 4:30am by the pounding beat and bass from the bar physically located next door. The constant noise was utterly horrendous, coming through the walls, floor and pulsating into the bed and pillows even through ear plugs. We were told by the (very nice) member of staff the next morning that they were not supposed to play music past 2am, but 2am is not much comfort either.Sunday night was (relatively) quieter and only until 12pm, while Monday night was silent. However for the simple fact that Saturday was so appallingly awful, and the primary thing one is paying for when booking a hotel is SLEEP, I cannot recommend this place if you are not also going to be out on the town until late, certainly not with a young family. One expects a certain amount of noise when staying in cities but this was off the charts.Which is all a big shame because the apartment is very nice, the staff are very nice and the location close to the Acropolis is great. Five stars for the place itself, minus three for the next door “Tiki Bar” equals two. Feel bad for the owners saying all this but at the end of the day they are knowingly taking money from paying guests. You can bet that it wasn’t our bad luck to be the first guests to be experiencing this.","April 9, 2019","20    Acropolis Stay

It is in the MOST ideal location - walkable to everything near the Acropolis and Plaka restaurants - pretty much right outside your door. Ideal if you are in Athens on a short stay and don't want to waste your time taking long cab rides anywhere. This is really more of a AirBnb type place (10-unit ""apartments""), and the people managing it are extremely friendly and take care of their guests. If you book here, note that because it is not a traditional hotel, there is no 24-hour concierge service, and that the management leaves at a certain time. They leave their cell phone numbers in a guide inside the room, but if you have any requests, better to make them when someone is still there.","September 23, 2018","20    Acropolis Stay

In terms of food, we tried a place called ""God's restaurant"" around the corner. The various eateries are pretty aggressive with pulling you in and persuading you to stay.

1185,"The Acropolis Stay I am still here as I write this review as I’m returning.. This hotel was a great find. A small block of rooms in the Plaka area which has the Acropolis (the Parthenon). The rooms are new, modern bathroom, vinyl flooring which I love. Beds are comfy and room cleaned everyday with fresh linen. There was only my husband and I however we opted for the family room, which is larger with a kitchen. It’s at the back of the building so it’s quiet and though you have other buildings for your view they do not encroach on your room. The area is great for the tourist shopping and normal shopping. Vasills the lovely manager was always there to help us in anyway.. ","May 4, 2018","20    Acropolis Stay

1188,"You can't really go wrong staying here when visiting Athens. For me, it hit all the marks in terms of location, access, style, cleanliness and overall comfort. The hotel is easy walking distance from the Acropoli metro station (use the main entrance on Makrigianni road, then head downhill), which makes getting around town super easy. At the same time, you are a short walk from the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum. You can also walk to nearby Hadrians Arch, the Temple of Olympian Zeus and Filopappou Hill (for a great view over Athens). The modern design studio style apartments (you have a small refrigerator, microwave and dishes) are compact, but spotlessly clean. The owners/managers are also a wealth of local information, but do note that the reception is not open 24 hours. One small drawback is street noise, which is to be expected in the heart of a big city. However, the windows do a very good job of reducing most of the street noise. Overall, a great, modern, convenient place to stay in the heart of Athens.Pro: location, ease of access, modern style, cleanlinessCon: some street noise in area","April 4, 2018","20    Acropolis Stay

Never having been to Athens, I was a little apprehensive about these reviews but have to say like all the other travellers before me - I too was suprised at just how good this place is. The rooms were first class and the hotel is within walking distance of everything your need for a short or longer trip. 2 mins walk to tube station and 10 mins walk from the X95 bus from the Airport, and 5 mins from Acropolis , museums and open top tour bus. We Arrived late at night but received very clear and specific instructions about getting the Room Keys and entry which made our experience hassle free, the breakfasts were delivered and were of a very high standard, nutritious and the room was cleaned beautifully ever day. I cannot say enough about the high standards this hotel has and the owner being availble to advise on places to eat and local trips or transport. If Tripadvisor had six stars this would have them!!!

I want to point out that we forgot to communicate that we were arriving late to the hotel the second time around and messaged the hotel via booking.com a few hours before we were flying out from the islands.

It was a bit like a game to follow the instructions pinned in various places! :)The apartment itself was very spacious & had everything we needed for the few days we would be staying there. The bed was good & firm and I got a good night's sleep on the first night (which is unusual for me in a new bed). The bathroom was large although the actual shower was a bit of a tight squeeze.The living area was lovely & spacious.Next morning we caught up with the reception staff who were very welcoming & informative & we explored the place more. There is a small shaded courtyard with seating, the laundry & a rather large lemon tree to shade the area! To be honest, I think the tree could be pruned a bit as it dominates the courtyard & affected the light that came into the apartment. Small niggle I know.The position of the apartments is perfect, being in a nice residential area with local bars, shops & restaurants nearby. Its right next to the ancient hippodrome & only about 30 minutes walk to the Acropolis. Just be careful of which way you arrive at the apartments. The most direct route can involve a climb of 75 steps to the street the apartments are on (I counted them!)All in all, it was a relaxing & welcoming place to stay & I would definitely consider booking again when I'm next in Athens.","October 22, 2018","21    Athens Green Apartments

1225,"Experience of our stay was well above our expectations. Our cruise disembarked in Athens at the end of October 2017. We were a group of 6 and rented 3 rooms of different sizes. All were clean and comfortable, walking distance to to several tourist sites and lots of restaurants in the area. The apartment is nicely decorated and above all, the hotel staff and the owner of the apartment were very friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and family. Will definitely go back should we visit Athens again.","November 7, 2017","21    Athens Green Apartments

1226,"We rented a 3 bedroom apartment for 2 adults and 3 kids in summer of 2017. The apartment was very clean and spacious. We would have been fine with a smaller unit. There is a grocery store nearby some decent places to eat at walking distance. The view is not that great but you should not book this apartment for that anyways. This is a well managed, clean accommodation from where you can walk a kilometer to metro and then explore Athens. The taxi from the airport will cost you quite a bit. You can rent a car for less than the amount for back and forth trip. On the way out, the nice guys who was managing this property dropped us to a nearby bus stop that has an express route straight to the airport. This is a much cheaper and very convenient option. You should look at this option instead of taxi if you are coming from airport. The manager should be able to give you the route number.","November 6, 2017","21    Athens Green Apartments

1228,"The apartment was very good and it was a good thing to have a washing machine at our disposal (even if it is not in the apartement but shared). Having a microwave would really be a +.The apartment was quite well located, not in the centre of Athens but in a quiet place. The receptionist was very kind and helpful. The only 2 ""negative"" points was that you can hear your neighbours at night (so even if it is located in a quiet place, if you have noisy neighbours, you might have difficult nights) and the cleaning was not well done (and as it is done only once every 2 days, it should be done well) so we had to ask to do it another time, which was done immediately, so it was ok.

Be careful not to park on Archimidous Street on Friday’s because your car will be blocked and you won't be able to use it till 17:00 in the afternoon that the market is finishing.The apartment was big, clean and well equipped and he people at the reception were extremely friendly and keen to assist us in everything we asked them.

1256,"This place is fantastic. The rooms are spacious and wonderfully decorated and kitted out. The rooftop pool, albeit unheated and not the biggest is a novel addition and was refreshing and gave wonderful views over the city. There is a gym as well, which looked like it was kitted out with modern equipment. The top thing this place has above all that is the staff. Hector in particular was an absolute gentleman. Really accommodating and helpful. We had a mixup with the agreed transfer pickup when we landed. 4am and no sign so had to just take 2 taxis. When we arrived it turned out the transfer company had gotten our dates wrong. We had an hour watching the sun come up lighting up the Parthenon by the pool, and Hector got the cleaning staff to get our room ready early so we could get in to make up for it. Really great guy. The only downside of Mosaico is that the area directly around it is a little run down, and walking from here to the central area can take you through some run down sections if you are not careful - however that aside there are stops for all the hop on off buses just around the corner and these were excellent to get you into the centre. Luckily as well there are 2 fantastic restaurants just the other side of the roundabout, Alexander the great and Mironi, which made staying in this area worth it. Really fantastic food. Also if you go near Syntagma and are looking for lunch - Vegan beat and Smak were both superb. For a long weekend or city break Mosaico is well worth it.","June 4, 2019","22    Athens Mosaico Suites & Apartments

1257,"We were a group of 5 adults and 3 children aged 13-6 and we stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment on the third floor. The bedrooms were a bit smaller than we expected and all 3 rooms had queen beds instead of the third bedroom having 2 twin beds as listed in the website, but we all made do. There are only 2 bathrooms however so it's best suited for large families who don't mind sharing bathrooms. Speaking of which, some of the fittings in the bathroom were problematic, such as the holder for the phone shower which was loose. They seem to have fixed it on our last day there, but not sure if it was replaced or a short term solution.We stayed for 3 nights, and 2 full days we were out touring Athens and the Peloponnesian region, so in terms of crashing for the night, doing some laundry (washing machine and detergent pods are available in the room) and grabbing quick bites within walking distance, this apartment delivers. For proper meals and shopping however, I'd recommend walking or taking a cab to Plaka or Ermou street respectively.The reception staff were extremely helpful, and when we couldn't figure out the washing machine or Air Conditioning (which is concealed as a painting) they came up to assist. Speaking of the A/C, just point the remote control at a squarish vent which looks like a painting in each of the rooms and the vents will open up. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and would come again, maybe we'll luck out and get one of their bigger rooms next time.","April 29, 2019","22    Athens Mosaico Suites & Apartments

1263,"The Athens Mosaico Suites and Apartments is actually one of the best places we have ever stayed in since we have been traveling around the world. We have stayed at numerous five star hotels but seemed to enjoyed our stay at this amazing and convenient apartment. Some of the reasons that we can think of are as follow:1. The staff at the front desk are very friendly. I know this sounds cheesy. However, this is very important to customer service. The young lady that worked on the morning of 14 December was very nice and welcoming. She helped us get settled and provide us with options of what we can do in the area. This is important because were just landed from the airport and really needed good advice.2. The apartment was in immaculate condition. This is an understatement!. The apartment really surpassed our expectations.The rooms were clean with all the amenities needed. We even had a washer, dishwasher, microwave oven and a fully supplied kitchen which was not expected. We had the option to cook if needed with a full size range/oven and mid size refrigerator. The one and half bathroom made a big difference when dealing with a large family of four or more. The very large balcony was soothing and the apartment as a whole was very spacious. We felt safe about the fact that every window had automatic shutters and the garage kept our vehicle safe too.The 24 hour front desk clerk is a must and you done a superb job providing one as well.3. The apartment was conveniently located next to other five star hotels in the area. This is important because we didn't have to walk far to be picked up for our one day cruise which we enjoyed so much. We were located next to convenient stores, restaurants, bars and other shops. We could not ask for more.4. Customer service as a number one priority. Everyone made us feel welcome. We were greeted with smiles and and staff were friendly. We received daily room service with fresh towels and the service really exceeded our expectations. The apartment is out of this world in terms of technology and the internet was fast. You guys really know what you are doing and were appreciated it.A few things to improve on:1. Please keep the pool open always. We currently live in Germany and swimming is a commodity. When on vacation, we want to enjoy the swimming pool. We understand that the pool is under renovation for the better. When finished, it will be heated and will have all the best technologies. However, we want to know this before we book the apartment. This is very important to us as a family.2. The underground parking although is very safe, was a bit hard to access. We had the toughest time getting our vehicle out of your garage due to the steepness of the entrance and exit. This needs to be slightly improve ASAP. On the last day, we ended up having a local guy exit the vehicle out of the steep garage for us. We just didn't feel safe to do it on our own. Please work on this and place safety first.All in all, The apartment was a 9/10 for us. We will visit Athens again and we do plan on staying with you guys. Hopefully next time, the pool renovation project will be finished and we can enjoy the 8th floor after all. We are also looking forward other renovation projects you have planned. The location of the apartment is not the best but definitely not the worst either. We really enjoyed our stay at the Mosaico Suites and Apartments and look forward to seeing you guys again soon.","December 17, 2018","22    Athens Mosaico Suites & Apartments

1264,"Our minibus driver has trouble finding this hotel because it is in a quiet lane off the main street. When we found it, the bus could not enter the narrow lane due to the cars parked there. So we were dropped off a short distance away to walk to the hotel. We stayed in 2 apartments which were super clean and had modern decor. Each had a fully equipped kitchen with a large fridge and dishwasher. There was also a washing machine. The apartment was cleaned daily and fresh towels also provided daily. The housekeeper even helped put our laundry on the rack when we were out.My only problem was with the Security door knob. The lock was so cumbersome to unlock and we had to call Panos from reception several times to open the door for us.But overall , we enjoyed our stay there.","November 22, 2018","22    Athens Mosaico Suites & Apartments

1265,"Stayed here with my husband for past 3 nights. We stayed in a 2 bedroom split level apartment as we found a good late deal.Very stylishly decorated, with apartment consisting of 2 bedrooms (both en suite), main bathroom and combined living room/kitchen/dining room. Also had narrow terrace. Well stocked, new kitchen (dishwasher, washing machine, microwave, oven, fridge freezer, kettle, toaster, coffee machine, pots/pans etc) so easy to cook. Only downside was that there was only 1 couch so tricky if 4 sharing. Would have been nice to have at least one armchair. All rooms had black out blinds and found it quiet in the block, so easy to sleep. Bed was extremely comfortable and there was air con and heating, if needed. Bathrooms stocked with toiletries and even slippers, which was a nice touch.Great location, about 2 minutes walk to nearest Metro stop and great nearby bakery (Bread Factory). My Market supermarket also nearby. Limited car parking available in the basement (although difficult drive out due to steep ramp) and lovely infinity pool on 8th floor. Staff were fantastic, lending us a UK converter and providing recommendations/local news. Would definitely stay here again if in Athens!","November 18, 2018","22    Athens Mosaico Suites & Apartments

1268,"My wife, our nearly 4 year old son, and I, stayed here for 3 nights, and we throughly enjoyed our stay.We arrived at around 9pm Greek time from the airport by taxi, and were met by a nice, smartly dressed man who checked us in quickly. His English was good, and we asked him about local amenities, and places to eat, as our young son was hungry having come straight from the airport. Nothing was too much trouble, and he ordered us a traditional Greek meal from a local takeaway , that was delivered to the room(!) within 25 minutes (and it was delicious!)The night before leaving, we had to be on the 7:30am ferry from the local port. We asked for his opinion on what time we should order a taxi, and then ordered the taxi through him, all done with minimal fuss and efficiency.RoomsThe decor is ‘upmarket’ and the room we had was extremely spacious and comfortable. The beds were also comfortable, and the room was cleaned daily.We had a two room suite, which suited us perfectly, as our little one had a room all to himself, with a double bed! Both of our rooms had electric shutters so as to keep the sun out, and the room secure (albeit we were 4 floors up!)Balcony.We had a huge balcony, which we ate dinner on 2 of the 3 nights we were there.Air Con.All worked well, and were quiet.WiFi.Worked at 3-5Mps. So if you are editing or uploading be aware. We streamed a movie or two through Netflix and it worked fine, with little to no buffering...The pool.What. A. View! Phenomenal! It is situated on the top floor and is open air. When we used it, it was either empty or had one personal using it. It is quite narrow, and at the time of writing this, it is decorated in small square blue mosaic tiles,several of which are missing. Now for me personally, this did not take the enjoyment out of using the pool, it is just something to note. It is an infinity pool with a railing to stop any ‘accidents’ out of eye line 5 or so feet away from the edge of the pool.It also has a nice corner seated area 15-20 foot away from the pool, so if you do have little ones, you can see them whilst at the play.LocationWe walked into the city centre and it took us 20-25 minutes with a buggy. We cut through the market area of the town, and were in the city centre in no time at all.I found this Hotel/Apartments to be excellent.Views 5/5Staff 5/5Value for money 5/5Amenities 5/5Location 5/5","September 7, 2018","22    Athens Mosaico Suites & Apartments

1270,"Situated in a very central part of Athens, this accommodation is a real find.Beautifully decorated throughout, with excellent air-conditioning and extremely modern designed apartments. We had a huge balcony which was great for drinking wine or having a few snacks. We had a 2 bedroom apartment, both having super comfortable beds and crisp linen, lots of storage place for clothes, fabulous electric shutters that made the rooms, if you wanted, a total blackout. The bathrooms were scrupulously clean, amazing shower and fab amenities. We had a great lounge area to watch tv and relax too. Kitchen is extremely contemporary with a huge fridge to fill if you so wish.The pool is just lovely. Great rooftop view, and a little area to relax with a bit of cover from the sun. Unfortunately, we were unlucky enough to be mobbed by a huge family of children, it didn’t matter if we tried to huddle at the other end of the pool, we couldn’t escape them so we just gave up and left them to rampage on. There’s lots of missing mosaics in the pool, it does look like a huge job to fix but it would really give an ultra finish to the pool once done.There’s onsite parking which is very handy. If you are not good at hill starts, you might want to use street parking. I’ve been driving for 18 years, and it really was a test to get out!Ridiculously close to a tube station, it couldn’t have been easier to get around!Lastly the staff were phenomenally kind, helpful, spoke excellent English and never tired of the relentless tourist asking a thousand questions, thank you!Can’t wait to come back!!!!","July 20, 2018","22    Athens Mosaico Suites & Apartments

We were greeted by Veronica on our arrival and she was on duty most days during our stay - she is a delight and a great credit to her employer. The apartments are well equipped, spotlessly clean and very contemporary. Literally 2 minutes for the metro station and a 15 minute journey from the Acropolis. Wonderfully situated to holiday or work in Athens. The apartments have a gym and a roof top pool - its not heated so not for the fainthearted in February, but from the roof you get a great view of the city and the Parthenon. There is a street market in the adjacent street on Wednesdays which was a delight for us as tourists. We ate in the pool bar restaurant of the Hotel Stanley on the first night for convenience and had a very acceptable meal in lovely surroundings.The apartments have only been open since November 2017 and I am sure they will be very busy with such standards.

The view from the GB roofgarden restaurant is spectacular - the Acropolis is always in full spectacular view. Changing of the guard at the parliament is just across the road - get up early and see the 6am change, we did and we were the only ones apart from the guards there. Rooms are sumptuous but not large. Courtyard view rooms whilst not a special view are quiet with no city noise.Another tip if you're able - we hired Lime Scooters which are scattered everywhere with a base just across the road in the plaza, and used them to go everywhere!

On point on her dealings with her guests. Great assistance from Tzortzia, she emailed to me . What a cordial person. I was instructed to go to the Butler reception in the 6th floor whom I met Erin who checked me in and assisted by the professional butler Grorge they made sure that my dinner reservation at the rooftop lounge was confirmed I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite Thank you it’s a classic and beautiful, elegant and luxurious. I looked up at the 2 beautiful chandeliers. Gold finished bathrooms (2) windows overlooking the courtyard they gave us amenities for my birthday also with nice greeting cards ♥️ I was very grateful to be treated like VIP Thank you! I was totally amazed. Free breakfast at the rooftop lounge overlooking the view of the Acropolis & the Parliament, the Lycabethus . The next day I had spent my time at the Spa. I was toured around by Lola, I really loved the ambiance and the gorgeous elements of the whole property. Beautiful lobby, huge decor details it’s convenient location nearby hop on hop off pick up. Restaurants are available, safe surroundings. As we arrived, so many bellmen available to assist every guests . Intellectual way of catering your luggages was in a different access in order not to congest their entrance & maintain the beautiful atmosphere of the lobby. I was impressed. The elevators are classic. They have a beautiful staircase I am very blessed to experience this luxurious hotel.

1281,I first stayed here in 1988 just after finishing college. It had left an indelible mark on me and my wanting to return. The chance presented itself this June as I got to stay for 2 nights. Right off the bat it was a great experience: from the friendly welcome of the porters and bellmen to the amazing upgrade to the butler servir floor. (At no cost)The roof deck has a spectacular view of the acropolis but during the day but most especially as the sunsets. The bar tenders make excellent cocktails and everyone is super friendly.

1282,We started at the Hotel Grande Bretagne at the beginning and end of our Greece trip. We were given a suite upgrade the first time and a smaller upgrade the second. It’s a great location. The décor is certainly historic. It does feel a bit dated but modernization would lose its charm. There is good water pressure. Staff was relatively friendly. Breakfast is had on the roof which has great views of the Acropolis. Breakfast itself was average though lots of options. We skipped it the second day and upon our return visit. The location is central to both Plaka and the Acropolis. It is also next to the parliament building which we understand can lead to demonstrations out front.

Pool service was amazing, our lunch was fantastic and they always kept our water glasses filled. The attention to detail is amazing at this gorgeous hotel.

1291,"An oasis in the heart of Athens! It's hard to say enough good things about this hotel. This is a hotel on a grand scale. It feels a little bit like Hearst Castle inside. Soaring ceilings, gilt furnishings, an elegant lobby, richly appointed rooms, and enormous marble bathrooms. You feel spoiled here. The staff is amazingly solicitous too. We once were asked if we would prefer black linen napkins so that the white linen wouldn't leave lint on our clothes. The location is awesome: right next to the parliament building (where you can see the changing of the guard) and an easy walk to the Parthenon (ten min or so). Now let's talk about the view. This will probably be the thing you remember most about this hotel. It's, in a word, unparalleled. When you walk off that elevator into the dining room on the top floor, your jaw can't help but drop. There is the Parthenon in all its glory, sitting perched on its rocky outcrop, like it's there for your own personal viewing pleasure. Of course it's not, and all the other guests clamber for the tables next to the railing for the best view too. The staff does their best to accommodate, and really, EVERY table in the dining room has an exceptional view. One evening we wanted a reservation to dine at dusk so we could watch the Acropolis light up as night fell (truly magical). The Grand Bretagne could not accommodate us so they got us a reservation at their sister hotel the King George just right next door. It was equally luxurious and the view was just as spectacular (maybe even a little better, if possible). It was a night we’ll remember forever. The daily breakfast buffet was as grand as the hotel itself, with a stunning selection of options. And of course, they were happy to custom prepare anything for you if you were not satisfied by the overabundance of food already in front of you. There was a nice pool with wonderful views of the Aegean and a bar where you could order snacks and drinks. This was a popular spot and it was usually crowded (good luck finding a lounge chair).

1294,"This is our first trip to Greece and we are celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary, so we wanted to go all out. We selected the Hotel Grande Bretagne for its location, its history, and its grander. Our stay was just what we expected and more. Located in the heart of Athens, we had it all. The roof top restaurant’s views are breathtaking as you look up at the Acropolis and then down to the Parliament. The food, the wine, and the service were 5 star. There is also a roof top pool where you can unwind from a day of touring the many sights of Athens. If you are planning to go to Athens, the GB should be your first choice.

It's location is ideal; opposite Synatagma Square and very close to the Greek Parliament, Many restaurants, shops and ancient sites are an easy walk, as is the beautiful National Gardens. Breakfast is served at the rooftop restaurant which has views of the Acropolis. Plenty of space in rooms with a modernized bathroom.

1297,"First thing everyone said when they heard we were going to Athens was, ""Oh, you don't need to spend more than a day there. It's ugly and seedy"". That was NOT our experience at all. Interesting, shining city with unimaginable history and rather vibrant. Grand Bretagne is in a great location: easy walking distance to all kinds of activities including Parthenon; gorgeous city park; public transportation; Greek Parliament; embassies; high end shopping; tons of restaurants. The hotel itself is quite grand and staffed with courteous, professional personnel - everyone from front desk staff; concierge; poolside; restaurants; housekeepers. Rooms were well appointed. Bathrooms were large and had both luxury tub and full size shower. We were on the second floor facing the square and had a birdseye view of Parliament's Changing of the Guard. People would line up about a half hour ahead to watch. We had an unobstructed view from Room 210. Rooftop pool is nice size and fun. Full bar includes snack food. Full service restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Cannot convey the jaw-popping view of Acropolis and Parthenon. If you can't stay at the hotel, do at least check out the rooftop for a drink at very least. Well worth it. And restaurant staff was solicitous, courteous and knowledgeable. Our daughter has a dairy allergy and they were so helpful revising the menu to suit her. Also went to Alexander's Cigar Bar. If you look closely, you notice the netting they have covering the ""open air"" roof to prevent mishaps with birds. Quite a nice touch, really. Gym well-appointed. Great hotel for families, couples, friends, business. Highly recommend.","June 18, 2019","23    Hotel Grande Bretagne, A Luxury Collection Hotel

Is breakfast worth 35 Euros - no. Especially if you are not a big breakfast person. Actually, none of the food is worthy of their prices so don’t focus in all meals here. Augment with incredible places near this central location. Ports for cell phones but my adapter didn’t fit “sunken” plugs. Hotel adapter fried my curling iron. if you are on a cruise and want a true 5 star? Then stay here. Being a Marriott member is an added perk!

1300,"While many 5 star hotels we’ve been to often ask that famous question “what else can we do to make your stay better?” but often fall short of delivering “5 star service”, GB has amazingly succeeded in every way! I give high praises to the management for delivering flawless 5 star service that seems to always anticipate and exceed my expectations. It is the consistency of every single service staff from maids saying hello each and every time they see you, to the restaurant staff who never let your water glass come close to being empty or an empty butter wrapper to even sit on your dining table for more than a minute and the pool staff to immediately come assist with towels before you even sit down. I commend such exquisite consistent service. Rooms and locations can not be beat. We were here for 5 nights and are Titanium Elite with the BonVoy program. We’ve stayed at the best hotels in the world but by far GB has left an impression that leaves me wondering why are not all 5 star hotels following GB’s lead?

1303,"This was one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in. The location is superb - walkable to all of the historic sites and near to the charming shops of Plaka, across the street from Syntagma Square which is a lovely little park. From our balcony we could see the Acropolis (and watch it be hit by lightning one of the evenings we were there!) and watch the changing of the guard with their funny shoes at the Parliament. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous. Our room was well appointed, the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was unbelievable, all in marble and up-to-date yet superbly elegant. The rooftop bar was expensive but where else can you enjoy a cocktail while looking at the Acropolis? Breakfast was served there as well, not included but well worth paying the extra - it was a delicious buffet with everything you would expect along with local favorites. We booked the hotel through our Virtuoso travel agent and received little extras like a complimentary lunch and a small bottle of liqueur in the room, not sure if they do that for everyone.

We are also used to staying in the best hotels on our travels and cannot recommend this one highly enough. We chose this hotel for its location and old colonial British design as we are not fans of modern architecture. The service is 5 star and the attention to detail is just amazing.

1307,"This hotel is to die for, but I’m giving it a 4 star because my room smelled like smoke. The hotel is spectacular and simply beautiful. The staff was kind and service was superb. The rooms were great but I was placed on the 2nd floor room 253 and because the cigar lounge is on this floor my room reaped on smoke through the vents. It was disturbing because I have bad allergies. They said they were full so I had to endure the smoke so for this reason I’m giving them s 4 star. I advised the rep at the front desk when checking out and they still charged me 4 euros for the city tax or something. I thk that wasn’t good customer service because they shouldn’t have charged me for that night stay since I was sick from cigar smoke. Oh well I find other countries don’t treat you like the USA when things are just right. I would stay here again but I wouldn’t dare stay on the 2nd floor. I would request a higher floor.

1332,"We arrived at 1.30am having had the flight from hell delay from Edinburgh to be met by a lovely looking building with a closed door and a key pad. Naturally tempers were fraying and I couldn't find the booking papers, but the door opened to be met by a friendly face and we were swiftly conveyed to our Junior Suite! The Hotel is immaculate, staff very friendly and helpful. It's in the ideal location at the bottom of the Plaka within very short walking distance of all the major sights. Breakfast on the roof top just sets it off... try the Greek Omelette! Both Continental and hot options, with cereal, bread, yoghurt, fruit,all help yourself. There's a safe and fridge in the room (complimentary bottled water), hairdryer and all the usual toiletries in the bathroom. Never had a problem with the hot water in the shower and the bed was comfortable and air conditioning spot on. This is a lovely boutique hotel, the staff are amazing and having stayed at the Athens Was previously, I know I'd come back to Home and Poetry anytime. The only thing the room lacked was tea and coffee making facilities, but it wouldn't stop me coming back, as the view from the roof top with a Coffee beats the room any day!","June 23, 2019","24    Home and Poetry

1334,Small and friendly boutique hotel right in the heart of central Athens.Comfortable hotel with nice rooftop bar.Breakfast was okay and plentiful if not amazing and the evening meals were basic but fine. If you’re looking for gourmet food then eat out but for location it’s ideal. Price was slightly high in my opinion but it’s right in the heart of the city so I guess it’s justified. One criticism would be the bathroom shower which was temperamental with no hot water on one occasion but other than that it was all good.Enjoy.,"June 4, 2019","24    Home and Poetry

1336,"My recent first time stay at Home and Poetry (fourth visit to Athens) was great. I picked this boutique hotel because of the location, short walk to Acropolis entrance , to numerous shopping stands, cute little tavernas. I like the history behind this building and inside decor. Can not beat delicious, generous breakfast on the rooftop with stunning view of the Acropolis. Such a treat. Thank you ladies working the breakfast area for making our fresh eggs and omelettes from scratch. Separate thank you to the check in team and especially THANOS ! So welcoming, so friendly, trying to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We had a little hick up the first night, and Thanos resolved the matter in the BEST, professional manner i am so grateful Thanos. Many thanks to you. Because of it, i would stay at Home and Poetry again and recommend this cute boutique hotel to others. Very good value for the price (and i stayed in a quite few hotels in close proximity ). Taking this opportunity, i wanted to recommend taverna Saita 5 min walk from the hotel. This was recommended to me by the bartender at Brettos (another MUST in Plaka if you like good ouzo or wine, they have extensive list) and boy did we enjoy. Locals eat there and it’s family owned and operated, that baked Aubergine is out of this world. Felt like at home among the family dinner. And there is cute little Greek Orthodox church right next to taverna.Yamas !","April 25, 2019","24    Home and Poetry

I do not recommend the room I was in which was called ""Eggonopoulos"" ( a poet-thus the name of the hotel) which is the first room at the top of the stairs as you enter the building. It is loud as folks enter and leave. The street itself is a bit noisy too but manageable for me with ear plugs. It is close to the Plaka but has cars and a fair amount of foot traffic. The WiFi was not great either but not a deal breaker. The breakfast area on the rooftop is small given we got a rainy spell and they could not accommodate seating for all of us trying to leave in the morning for various locations. I am sure it is lovely on the patio if the weather isn't rainy (or windy). The food breakfast was substantial and good.

Most of the major antiquities are within easy walking distance and being in Plaka and next to Monastiraki means you’ll have also access to many restaurants to suit every pocket. Right, Hôtel staff exceptionally helpful and kind. On our last day one of us was unwell and they allowed us some extra time in the room. There are three floors of rooms with a rooftop dining area. Breakfast is good - rolls, juices, cereals, some fresh produce. Coffee from a machine. And you have a marvellous view of the Acropolis- but you can’t see the Parthenon. The area is open for snacks and drinks of an evening. The rooms are in excellent condition- looking like recently done. Finished to a high standard. Bed firm and suited us. Bathroom a little on the small side but well appointed. Excellent TV that went down well, especially Netflix. Air con quiet and effective.

We stayed in a poetry suite with an outside entrance and it was Wednesday night in Athens so the noises from the street was very loud and we had to sleep with earplugs. The room was very nice though, the bed very comfortable and the staff was super super friendly and helpful. I would definitely like to stay there next time, but maybe ask for a room inside or just remember my earplugs again.","April 17, 2018","24    Home and Poetry

1373,"We just returned from a lovely stay at this hotel. the location is super and is a plus point if you want to work your way through the cultural sites of Athens. We enjoyed a good breakfast which offered a continental selection and we though the rooms were clean and comfortable. Looking at the pictures there is definitely a range of rooms and we had a rather small one, Kavadias, but it was suitable for our needs. I think the suggestion of a kettle and tea + coffee would be all I would add. Friendly service and you step out and see Hadrian's Arch. Worth a stay if you are looking for an Athens gem.","April 14, 2018","24    Home and Poetry

Walking distance to Acropolis, Plaka, the Temple of the Olympian Zeus and other attractions. I love how the rooms were named after Greek poets. We stayed in the Kariotakis room. I have a made it a point to look up that poet, thanks to this hotel.","April 2, 2018","24    Home and Poetry

1375,"My Husband and I had a wonderful experience at Home & Poetry! We came here for an operation that I was having, so I wanted a big cozy ""home-like"" room, to be comfortable in afterwards. The accomodations and view were very important to me. Perfect location, attentive staff, and comfortable room - Overall, a five star bed & breakfast and super clean. As guests here at this bed & breakfast and, owners of a bed & breakfast in Ibiza, Spain, we feel that there is always room for improvement at every establishment. Egyptian cotton sheets, down-filled comforters/pillows, more television stations (movie ones like HBO, Showtime, Etc..) in Universal languages like English and Spanish, would accommodate guests that are here to rest and relax and that are from somewhere, outside of Greece. The bathroom towels are of high quality and soft - Great to the touch. However, the shower floor is slippery and needs to be fixed to prevent falls. Also, bathrobes would have been nice additions to the rooms. This is an old building with beautifully reconstructed rooms and the prettiest hardwood floors, we have ever seen. So, you can hear people come and go at all hours and we feel that as conscious guests, other guests should be more conscious when entering and exiting the building, at any hour. Maybe bringing soft, indoor slippers for one to wear, while you are inside the building, could be the solution to more of a quiet environment with out the hotel, covering the gorgeous wood floor. That is one of the reasons we chose this place. Also, the guests being made more aware about opening and slamming doors shut - It can be loud for all the rooms. And, please don't walk around with your high heels on in your room - The sound echoes and disturbs other guests in the hotel at all hours. It's rude and inconsiderate and maybe if your level of consciousness is so low, then you should stay at a modern cookie cutter hotel that has carpet, not a boutique vintage Inn with wooden floors and lots of character (the artwork is stunning). As for food, the hotel doesn't have a restaurant. We highly recommend not eating around the hotel either. Tourist food - Poor quality and pricey. We found some good restaurants that were walkable or a 5 Euro taxi ride and so much better quality. Cookoovaya (best Greek salad ever) is one that we really enjoyed. Ask the cook at Home & Poetry, for suggestions - He will lead you to the right restaurant for lunch and dinner. Breakfast here is simple and good - Delicious creamy fresh Greek yogurt, daily baked spinach pie and croissants, and fresh squeezed orange juice...Delicious. Taxis are a bit stinky (smokey) and sketchy (drivers). Make sure the drivers start the meter when you get inside and not charge you a fixed price. The only fixed price is that to the airport which we paid 35 Euros from Home & Poetry - It took us 40 minutes to get there. A+ for this lovely new bed & breakfast in the heart of Athens and we will definitely stay here, the next time we come back to this city. We will also tell our friends and clients to stay here as well - Thank You!! P.S. - Free entrance to Greek ruins the first Sunday of every month. ** Great tip!","March 12, 2018","24    Home and Poetry

1376,"I would have liked to share the positive experience of many of the other reviewers. However, my experience with the hotel was rather disappointing. I therefore can recommend to choose this hotel only if you are 100% sure that you will arrive there as otherwise you could share my unpleasant experience which is in contrast to the quite cosy name of the hotel.The hotel originally requested the full no show fee (price for four nights) although they knew from my mail on the evening of the first night that I will not make it as I missed the plane to Athens due to the late arrival of the feeder train to the airport. No chance to be in Athens also on the next day. Thus, I proposed to postpone the stay by three weeks. For some reason, they insisted that they only learnt on the second day of our stay that I would not come and therefore they considered fully legitimate to claim the full no show fees. Update: After some time consuming and intense discussions (including legal consultancy on my side) the hotel manager finally accepted to refund the difference between the no show fees and the regular cancellation fees in accordance with the booking confirmation. I am traveling a lot and I am still highly irritated by such a commercially driven behaviour.","March 2, 2018","24    Home and Poetry

1378,"We stayed in mid FEB 2018 . What a delightful boutique hotel in the center of the Plaka area . I booked two rooms as were were traveling with my elderly in-laws. Check in was smooth and our rooms ready upon arrival . I called the hotel prior to request rooms be on the same floor and were happy to discover the hotel was obliging. The rooms are named after famous Greek poets , which is quite romantic. The rooms are generously sized , ours had 2 windows that open up , we were on the 3rd floor , rooms overlook surrounding apartments . Enough room to fit our luggage and there is a desk and chair . The staff were wonderful, always willing to assist with their local knowledge. The breakfast is served on the roof top patio which has indoor and outdoor dining .A great view of the Acropolis. A lovely spread of pastries, rolls , cereal, juice , fresh fruit , yogurt as well as boiled eggs.Filter Coffee was sufficient, the will make you Greek coffee is you ask. The lift is quite small , enough for 2 people . Never had to wait too long to use the lift . There is a flight of stairs at the entrance of the hotel. This may not be suitable for elderly with limited mobility.","February 14, 2018","24    Home and Poetry

1382,"I wouldn't call this a spacious hotel, but then you can't really expect such from a hotel of this vintage sitting directly in the middle of one of the most ancient cities on earth. Everything has been retrofitted and renovated to a beautiful finish. The ceilings are high, the vintage windows work well and offer great vies of the neighborhood. Stunning views of the Parthenon from rooftop dining! The breakfast is ok. The only complaint is that everything except for the hard boiled eggs are served cold. However, there is a good selection, the buffet is refreshed regularly and they fresh squeeze the orange juice right in front of you. The coffee and teas are decent. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The place is immaculately clean. I would rate the walkability score as a 98 or more. Nearly everything you could possibly want as a tourist is within 10 minute walk including shops, dining, souvenirs, historical sights such as the Acropolis, Areopagus, Roman Market, Ancient Market, etc.. Lulu's Bakery is a great local eatery to stop by for lunch (5 minute walk). There is a piazza within a few minutes walk of the hotel which has many restaurants and coffee shops with a relaxing atmosphere. The narrow, winding cobble stone streets are a pleasure to wander through. The only two downsides to this hotel is that there is no place in the rooms to sit and relax as the rooms are not large enough to accommodate the extra furniture and there is no parking. Street parking is a risk for tickets from 8:00am - 9:00pm (after which the municipal police are not patrolling for illegally parked cars.) After 9:00 pm you can park your car basically anywhere it will fit. (Keep in mind, the streets are incredibly narrow. You will have to park all the way against or on the curb and still fold the side mirrors in to avoid being hit by a passing car) Other than that, there are a few public parking lots in the neighborhood that you can get 24 hour parking with in & out accessibility for 15€ / day. (Be waste of scams. Ask for a receipt when you park your car. If you need the police to assist you with a shady business man just dial 100 on any phone and the police will quickly arrived to assist.) All in all, an excellent place to stay. Friendly staff, amazing antique building lovingly restored in a quiet ancient neighborhood the likes of which you can't easily find elsewhere on earth..","November 9, 2017","24    Home and Poetry

However staying just one block outside the Main Street allowed us to easily explore the small boutique shops and small bakeries and cafes.The amenities and lodging were also excellent.The rooms were spacious for all 4 of us, with 2 bedrooms, living area and a kitchenette.There is a supermarket right down the street where we would purchase eggs and cook them every morning and have it with the bread the hotel staff delivered every morning.

The location was great - everything we wanted to see in our short stay was in walking distance, and it was a pleasant little spot with nice cafes, restaurants, and a market, in case you want to make use of the kitchen in the room. Breakfast was simple, but it was nice that they served it in the little table in our room. Nice and cozy! When we arrived, they gave us a little tray of snacks and two shots of some strong Greek booze. Nice! My wife and I are from New York City, and we have travelled all over the world.

Location was ideal, we walked everywhere, in fact covered nearly 25 miles on foot in just 3 days. But what really makes Met34 special is the attention shown to guests by staff. Every request was accommodated, every question answered. Complimentary olive and cheese plate upon arrival, and complimentary gin and tonic from Dimitrius the night before we departed (he makes a delicious one, and we had the pleasure of enjoying his conversation while enjoying his crafted cocktails as a nightcap each evening).

The staff is very welcoming and were careful to show us many spots to consider visiting on our stay. The rooms are beautiful and very high tech with electronic blinds and blackout shades. The fridge in the room was stocked with milk and cold cuts and there was coffee and espresso for us to take advantage of. The small kitchen would be very handy for a couple/family who might want to drop back into the hotel during a day sightseeing for lunch or snacks. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with a great rainhead shower. The only complaint we had was the street noise which can be very loud if you retire on the early side. We had just come from a cruise and had an early flight in the morning,so that was bothersome. However, if you typically don’t go to bed until after 11 pm or are not bothered by the noise from people in the street below, then the street facing room (#1) will not be a problem for you.","May 17, 2019","25    MET34 Athens

Thanks to Met34 staff for turning a stressful situation around for us. We highly recommend Met34 to anyone considering accommodations in the heart of Athens.

Easily walkable to all the main tourist sites and if you are renting a car it is about a 15 minute walk to the area where are the rental cars companies are located. Has a small hotel/apartment feel and not that big chain atmosphere.* Staff - They were extremely friendly and helpful. When I asked about rental cars they called a couple of different companies for me, arrange our car service, and did about anything else we needed* Rooms - Rooms were very good. We had had a two bedroom suite for our family. Both had large bathrooms and a sitting area. TV's are a bit small and outdated, but I don' think we turned them on when we were there.NEGATIVES:* Can be a bit difficult to get to. Cab drivers didn't seem to know it since it is such a small hotel. If you are going to be driving there with a rental car it may be tough to find/park.","November 26, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

The room was so modern with marble bathroom, small balcony, electric blackout shades, kitchenette, coffee/espresso machine, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, safe, wet sink, stove, dining table and so on. The location in the Plaka is excellent. Petraki street is parallel to Ermou the main pedestrian street, so you are close to all the action with wine bars/cafes, bakery, etc....but on a quiet street. Just a 15 minute walk to the Acropolis Museum and just a few minutes to the major squares of the area. The staff at the Met34 are just excellent. Breakfast is served in your room at the time you choose and the front desk staff are very helpful for arranging taxis and giving excellent advice on restaurants, etc. Bravo Met34!","November 13, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

1408,"We stayed here last week for our half term holiday. We all loved it! Brilliant to have two separate bedrooms and bathrooms, a small lounge and a small kitchen - and we used all the space between the 4 of us. Breakfast was fab - lots of continental offerings delivered to the room whenever you want it. Very centrally located and easy to walk to all central Athens attractions within about 20 mins. Very high spec - lots of leather, wooden floors and Wi-fi... plus lots of gadgets (lighting, blinds, air-con) - and great comfy beds! The only thing that let us down was the TV/tech... the hotel makes a deal of ‘international tv channels and latest technology’ - but our boys (11 & 10) were very disappointed... no kids TV in English - and no way to hook apple devices up to the TVs, to run mirroring. Despite that, the customer service was so amazing, we still had to give this 5/5 - we will definitely go back again (next time though, taking an Apple TV, Chromecast or Amazon stick!).","November 4, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

Breakfast was great in the morning (delivered to the room). The hotel is walking distance everywhere in Athens and easily reachable from the airport by bus (6 euros) or by metro (10 euros). When you walk out of the door there are tons of restaurants and shops. I wouldn't even consider another hotel in Athens.,"November 3, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

When I returned for our luggage the desk clerk handed me an envelope with all my money in it. You can be assured these are good people operating the hotel.Other matters...We were in Room 1. It faces the street. It can be a bit noisy but was quiet by 11 p.m. You may wish to request an inner room. The roomsare modern and clean. It is high tech (lights, blinds, climate all on one panel) and less tech savvy folks may take some time to figure it out. In room Continental breakfast was very good with fresh orange juice, a variety of breads, etc, cereal, yogurt and fruit. Staff was friendly and helpful. The location is very good...near the main shopping street, minutes from the parliament (changing of the guard at the memorial for unknown soldiers), and 15 minute or less walk to Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch and the Ancient Agora...also plenty of restaurants within a few minutes walk.Highly recommended.","October 29, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

From the time I booked our stay through tripadvisor until the time we checked out, I felt like I was truly a valued customer. The staff members are extremely friendly, attentive, helpful, and I honestly felt like I was being constantly being catered to! I wish all hotels could be like this one :) we arrived very early in the morning (2 am) and the kind gentleman at the front desk was friendly and polite. He walked us up to our room and showed us around. Every single staff member was helpful. The room itself was BEAUTIFUL. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom is luxurious, and the in-room amenities are very clean. They even had the sofa bed ready for us! This meant a lot to us because we just arrived from our long overnight flight and our children were exhausted. The location felt safe and it's not too busy.

1414,"We missed our flight and lost a night here. We ( party of 8) came in after being up since 4 am right after 11:00 am hungry and tired. We were given 2 spectacular rooms. The beds were heaven, the showers ceiling rain shower head felt like a warm hug. The kitchen was granite, we had our own wifi network, a large living room was inviting and spacious and we just wanted to rest when the concierge, brought in a large breakfast for all of us. That completely changed our mood and we went out to tackle Athens. We were at the center of everything! We were walking distance to the ruins, close to great restaurants, and shopping. The host gave us directions to everything. The service was not only professional but felt like home. We had a fight the next day and he packed us breakfast to go for us so we had something to eat on the way to the airport at 5:00 am. What was even better is I believe they refunded the money for the night we missed. I didn't even ask for this but was so thankful because I had to buy a hotel room for the 8 of us near the airport so it offset that expense. I had lost so much money not to mention missing that flight, so this really made me so grateful. I highly recommend this hotel. They made our 24 hours there the best it could possibly be.

Met34 will now be our go to hotel in Athens. The hotel is in the most perfect central location - within walking distance to Ermou, Syntagma, Plaka, Monastiraki and the Acropolis. We loved our room (the Metropolis Suite) which was large, comfortable and clean. My one very small complaint is the electronic blinds - it took a while to figure out how to tilt the blinds open, and it also took forever to open/close them. Other than that, everything was perfect.Thank you to the staff for all your kind help and recommendations. We will definitely be staying here in the future.","October 1, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

The rooms were very quiet. The room facilities were of a high standard and the staff at the hotel exceptionally helpful and professional at all times. I had asked them to order a wheelchair which they organised. They offered to provide my choice of transport from and to the airport which I found to be very helpful.

1423,On our family vacation to Santorini we needed a stopover on our journey...Athens being the most obvious we then went in search of a great hotel. Both my wife and I separately found Met 34 online. Once we booked we were welcomed into the most wonderful experience I’ve had with a hotel .From the moment you arrive you soon discover how helpful the staff are..I’d already experienced this with their very informative emails back and forth after my bookings..nothing was a problem.Hotel is located next to Plaka so our early morning arrival was pretty exciting and you discover all the fabulous cafes and restaurants in the street the hotel is on...every where you look there’s a supermarket..a hairdressers and 3 cafes next to hotel. ..all within walking distance as are the ancient ruins .The next big surprise we’re the rooms..like a little cozy apartment ..lovely bathroom and kitchen with a well stocked fridge and onto the beds..absolutely the best I’ve ever slept in..all my family agreed ..just so comfortable ....then there’s the little balcony which you feel like you are on a movie set..that James Bond or Jason Bourne have stayed here once.. really cool street sounds but also very quiet ...I awoke early and sat out there for an hour taking it all in..then you discover the wonderful shower and the beautiful bathroom .we were woken with a big smile and a beautiful continental breakfast ..same great vibes from the staff...10 stars would not be enough to compliment this great hotel experience in Athens..one of the best I’ve ever had ..because the staff and rooms are just brilliant ..bravo to the owners..the world needs more boutique experiences like this ...wish we had more time there .,"August 17, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

1424,"We stayed in their smallest room, which was only small by their own standards. It was large, airy, beautifully furnished and equipped with almost everything one would need for an exceptional stay. The hotel is only a 10 minute or so walk from the Acropolis....buy tickets on line so you won't be in the line for an hour in the heat waiting to buy your ticket there!! There are restaurants nearby, shopping is only one street over. There is a building under renovation across and down a bit from the hotel, but the windows and doors (spacious letting in loads of light) soundproofed what was going on outside. The air conditioning is excellent, so you won't have cold air blowing on you all night, yet the room is adequately cooled down, a good design. We were treated to shot glasses of liquor and a small snack on our return mid-afternoon, a very nice touch. We loved the coffee machine in the room, as well as the continental breakfast. I would just state that the room does need a kitchen towel, or serviettes of some kind. The internet worked. The bed was comfortable. I am not a fan of their pillows, so having perhaps one other type might be an idea, but that is a very small detail. Highly recommend this hotel.","August 16, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

1430,"We stayed 2 days in Athens and chose the Met 34 hotel. It is a newer boutique hotel well situated a block from Ermou street (main pedestrian street). It's less than 5 minuts from Syntagma Square (& Metro station) and about 10 minutes from the Athens Flea Market and 15 minutes from the Ancient Agora, Hadrian's Library and about 20 minutes from the entrance to the slopes of the Acropolis.We had a 2 bedroom unit that had 2 bathrooms (both with showers). All the furniture was modern and new, including the controls from lights, blinds, A/C). There was a desk area, kitchen with a stove, dishwasher, fridge. The master was huge and had a balcony that had two chairs to look at the street traffic.Breakfast was included which was served in room at a time of our choosing up until 11:00 or 11:30am. The front desk spoke perfect English and replied to emails efficiently. There are excellent restaurants on the same block--the best was the Athiinaikon-- just next door and Tazza + Ergon to the right. The only tricky thing is finding the hotel using Google maps or Uber. The hotel is located on 9 Petraki but Google Maps + Uber drop you off on the backside of hotel on Mitropoleus Street and you need to walk around the block to the front. The easiest drop off is in front of the Athiaikon Restaurant which runs between Petraki and Mitropoleus streets. There is a large taxi queue half a block away on Mitropoleus street in front of the Electra Metroplis Hotel. Taxi service (yellow cab) is a flat rate of 38 euros to/from Athens International Airport.","July 19, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

It is a quiet off street in the heart of everything, so you get the best of both worlds where you have a safe and secluded area but you are also extremely close to all the action.","June 8, 2018","25    MET34 Athens

1439,"Right in the middle of Plaka, is shops, bars, restaurants and walking distance from most sites. On a square, 10 mins easy walk from Metro station Monastiraki (metro from the airport is usually direct). Old building, beautifully converted into an elegant B&B: small, beautifully appointed rooms and bathrooms en suite; communal kitchen a few steps from your room where you can help yourself to breakfast; tea, coffee, fruit, cookies are available at any time. Rooms airconditioned, overlooking the square and its many restaurants & bars but very quiet. A 'walk-up' with a few stairs and staff are usually available to help with luggage; they are helpful, speak perfect English and offer useful tips. There is a lovely roof-top outdoor cinema (turn left out the door and its in front of you) - often films in original; there are 2 evening showings, book in advance to save the endless queue and perhaps being turned away. There is a bar with food at the back of the cinema. A brilliant location if you are spending a time in Athens - we couldn't fault it!","July 9, 2019","26    Palladian Home

When we arrived Pantalish (apologies if spelling is incorrect) was very polite and helpful and insisted on carrying our bags to the first floor. The room was very well presented with a lovely balcony overlooking the square - a very pleasant place to eat breakfast and have pre dinner drinks watching people go about their business.The breakfast provided was fresh with options including fruit, yogurt, cereal, toast, deli meats and cheese. Some of the negative reviews mentioned street noise but it is an old (beautifully presented) building in a tourist area and some noise should have been expected. We found that the noise didn't go on too late and in the mornings there was no noise at all.

Our view (see photos) matched the website’s promises. The room was clean and comfy, and they left a bottle of champagne in our room for our first night. Having the little kitchenette shared across the hotel with free drinks, breakfast and always replenished cookies is a nice touch. And the service was great, especially how they checked us back in after our trip out to the islands was done in by weather. There were a few negatives, but they were minor to me. The coffee machines in the kitchenette kept getting jammed. The stairs up to our room would be a challenge for those in I’ll health or feeling the effects of a night out. And some desk staff were more proactive in their hospitality than others. The location was great, perfect for a touristy stay.

It is in the Plaka tourist area. The Acropolis is short walk away through lots of eateries and shops. Tips: - There are no lifts, so not a good choice for mobility impaired. - The balconies are small but don’t let it go to waste!- The staff can offer advice, carry luggage to and from your room, and arrange a taxi for you. - Check out Cine Paris, an open-air rooftop movie theater a few steps from the hotel.

They were waiting for us and carried our bags upstairs for us (there’s about 60 to the room and they’re quite steep - so bare that in mind if you struggle as there is no lift!) This hotel feels more like a B&B. The rooms are cosy but have super comfy beds and good aircon. We stayed in the base room with no balcony next to the kitchen, it was a little noisy at times but nothing that woke us up. It’s a fantastic location close to the sites and restaurants. We went to Stamatopoulos for dinner (less than a 5 min walk) which I would also highly recommend, beautiful setting, live music every night and the food was fantastic.

1446,"This hotel is perfectly situated in the Plaka neighborhood. When we arrived, the two people who welcomed us were extremely gracious and wanted to do anything to satisfy us. We arrived a little early and our room wasn’t yet ready so they stored our luggage. The hotel has a keypad entry so it is pretty safe. It is right off a lively street lined with shops, restaurants and coffee shops. I was a little worried about noise from the streets but it didn’t bother me at all. We were in the Aphrodite room, which is adjacent to the kitchen area. Be sure you are able to go up stairs as there is no elevator. The room came with a large bottle of water and a bottle of wine, which we gave to the guests next door. The room provides the basic essentials and is adequate, nothing luxurious. If there is one thing a little negative, I would say the sound from the kitchen was a little disturbing. The stay included breakfast but it was self serve with trays to bring food to your room - no room to eat there. The food was simple - fresh breads and cakes, cheeses, meat, cucumbers and coffee/tea. After eating, you bring back your tray with dishes and put them in the sink. And the kitchen was available 24/7 for coffee, fruit and snacks. Got a bit noisy at times. And when the staff came early in the morning to clean and prepare, the clanking sound was was pretty loud. For those away from the kitchen it’s a convenience, for those next to it, it got a bit noisy. We did mention it to the staff and they were extremely apologetic. The next night it was a bit better. However that little inconvenience was lost to the place and people who work there. All the shops, restaurants and archeological sites are within a short walking distance. No need for a car, which we didn’t rent until we left Athens. (Also, by the way, we rented from Hertz, which had a very convenient office less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel). The staff helped us arrange for taxis and recommend restaurants. Very nice. I would stay there again but ask for a room away from the kitchen. ","May 12, 2019","26    Palladian Home

1449,"We visit a different European city every winter and this year was Athens. I wasn't overly impressed with Athens although the Greeks we met were all friendly. Very busy and throngs of people (and this is off-season) and riddled with graffiti. About 10% is artistic and the other 90% just plain ugly. Also many dilapidated buildings. The historic buildings and museums are very interesting and that saved the trip from being a complete disappointment. The other thing that saved it was our choice of staying at the Palladian Home Guest House. It is in a great location in the Pallaka district with loads of nice little shops, cafes and restaurants and near to the Acropolis. Beware that every shop keeper and restaurant owner will pester you to come and sample either their good food or their cheap prices! The young staff were lovely and couldn't have been more helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The ensuite bathroom was tiny. I struggled and I am not a big person but everything worked and was functional. There was street noise at nights but not so much that it kept us awake and after a couple of nights we got used to it. A continental breakfast was laid out in the kitchen with sufficient to give you a good start to the day. Cereal, breads and croissants, cheeses and hams, juices, teas and coffee. If I went back to Athens I would stay again at the Palladian Home but I don't every see us going back to Athens. Sorry!","March 20, 2019","26    Palladian Home

Bed was super comfortable and we loved our balcony with a view of The Acropolis. I cannot say enough about the friendly and helpful service we got from the staff at the tiny front desk....helping us with cab service, walking directions and translation. The dinner we had at the restaurant, Evita (sp?) right on the corner next to the Palladian Home entrance turned out to be one of the best meals we had in Greece....and to think we hesitated because it was so close!

Our room was on the first floor (really the second in Europe). We were glad for that as there is no elevator and it’s a spiral staircase up. The desk staff grabbed the suitcases and carried them for us. The room is a bit spare but serves its purpose - the bed was large and comfortable. There is a desk and a freestanding closet with a small fridge inside. The hotel provides free bottled water. The room and bathroom were immaculate. The small kitchen, which was next to our room was always stocked with fruit and cookies. Every morning, the staff put out thick yogurt, deli meats, cheese and pastries. One could go into the kitchen at any time and make a coffee. Since the hotel is in the Plaka, there are restaurants within 50ft of the front door. The evening shopping was vibrant. We walked to the Acropolis in about 10 minutes. We would stay again in a heartbeat and will hopefully get the chance again.

We got a room with a balcony overlooking the street however the view was somewhat lack luster. The room itself was clean and adequate however VERY small. If you like larger hotel rooms this won't be it. It had very high ceilings though which made it no so claustrophobic. There is complimentary breakfast at something like a communal kitchen.

Note: not all rooms face the acropolis so dont be fooled into thinking you will be seeing the hill from every room.Rooms: they have tiny cute balconies to sit outside attached to the room, spacious room, v. clean, comfy, wonderful bedding and A/C; quiet and low noise (despite being in the middle of Plaka Sq- which is a highly touristy LOUD location): the rooms facing the back have ZERO noise issue. we slept beautifully w/o any noise issues. Bathroom: very nice toiletries, clean B/R, however tiny shower, so be prepared for very cramped B/R.Breakfast: this is basic (think bread, jam, honey, croissant, Danish pastry, OJ, fruit, greek yoghurt, cake, cookies, cold cereal/milk) but the communal kitchen always has available coffee, tea, water, fruit and cookies, this snack availability 24/7 makes up for the basic breakfast. the convenience of 24/7 kitchen access is superb.Note: there is no elevator in this building so it wont be a problem for light traveller to lug their stuff up the stairs.Overall: I would stay here again: the super-central location, walking distance to all Ancient Athens Sites, uber cleanliness, wonderful helpful staff, 24/7 coffee/tea/snacks in communal kitchen and convenience of being inside Plaka Sq plus the feel of staying in someone's home rather than a commercial touristy hotel is what is very charming about this place.

It was a very romantic getaway for us. I would suggest staying here if you want to see historic Athens. Thanks, Ryan","August 13, 2018","26    Palladian Home

1471,"If you want everything at your finger-tips, this is the hotel! Everything is right there, or close by! The staff was absolutely wonderful! Ensure you ask for them to arrange for a driver to bring you to and from the airport to the hotel. Taxi drivers may have a hard time finding the hotel and drop you off 2 blocks away. The rooms are large, great accommodations with balconies. There is a small self-serve kitchen area for breakfast in the morning. We will definitely return to this hotel. It is absolutely in a great location and the beds were very comfortably. The air conditioning worked very well. We had 2 rooms which was ideal with our family.

1473,"This is a review for the Standard Single Room with ViewFor anyone visiting Athens I can strongly recommend the location of this hotel, it is very close to all the popular tourist sites all within walking distance.My room was small which is to be expected for a single room but the clear view across to the Acropolis was exceptional.The hotel including my room was tastefully decorated and the staff very welcoming.My only issue was that the door to the room did not block out the sound from the corridor, the sound of voices and footsteps woke me several times during the night. If this wasn’t the case I would have definitely given 5 stars.My ratings scale.....5 Star - flawless, exceeded expectations, would highly recommend 4 Star - very pleasant stay, met expectations, would recommend 3 Star - didn’t meet expectations, wouldn’t recommend 2 Star - had a unpleasant stay and experience, wouldn’t recommend 1 Star - Ruined my holiday, avoid at all costs.

Situated within walking distance to just about everything, the location could not be better. The room was spacious and clean, and the staff was lovely. There was a simple breakfast available each morning, and coffee and tea all day long. Great restaurants and shops surround Palladian Home, but once you walk through the doors, you are immediately transported from the hustle and bustle of the Plaka to a place of serenity and charm. During our 4-night stay, I often found myself saying, ""when we get home"" or ""we'll head home after dinner.""

There is a communal breakfast kitchen where you gather what you want for breakfast from an array of fresh breads,pastries, croissants, fruits, wonderful Greek youghurt, cold meats and cheeses and a variety of teas and coffees. We have eaten breakfast every morning on our balcony, watching the sun over the Acropolis and the stirrings in the street below. There are numerous excellent restaurants within a hundred metres, you are spoiled for choice.

1477,"We were there for a night in our last leg of our vacation, big family with plenty of luggages. We requested hotel to help arrange mini van. Hotel told us van cannot enter this area, but dont worry, driver will drop us off, and guide us to the hotel and help with the luggage. To our surprise, we were literally dropped off on the road side and driver left after we tipped him. It took us half an hour to find the hotel.Hotel is clean and nice. Night time service was excellent, all our baggage was portered up to our rooms. Rooms were deceivingly small, but fair for the price we paid. It is located in front of a beautiful court yard. Stay was pleasant. And if it were not for what happened next, i would have given this property a 4 star rating. The next day, we had an afternoon flight. Again transport was arranged by the hotel. We checked out and paid for everything including the transport. We were instructed to wait for the driver at the hotel. The driver was 30m late. When we kept asking the front desk, we were only told dont worry he will be here soon. Our flight is @ 1900 and it was already 1600. So i demanded the reception to ask the car company again. The message was that car was stuck in traffic, but it is now located where they dropped us off the day before.We rushed there with all our luggages only to be met with an empty street and no van. We went back to the hotel, to ask for the hotel to call again.... 5min he said! For precautionary measures, i asked for the number of the driver and rushed back to the pick up location. When i arrived, again no car. I called the driver’s number. He didnt speak english. I passed the phone to a restaurant waiter standing next to me. But i was told that the car is waiting about 1.5km away, a complicated set of directions was given to me. I looked at my watch and it was already 1730. I took the decision to call for a cab and was fortunate enough to catch my flight. What angered me was when i called the hotel to explain the situation and requested for my transport refund. I was told that it cannot be refunded! The hotel said that the car company has been doing business with them for a long time... etc etc. It may have been a miscommunication, it may be a scam.

1480,"I stayed at Palladian Home end of April for 6 nights. Nick and the staff went above and beyond to answer questions, provide suggestions, take care of any problems. From making recommendations of restaurants and shops, giving directions to stave off uncessary walking and getting lost, to assisting with itinerary on the other islands I was going to visit, persevering in helping me change an arrival date when my ferry was cancelled, they were very helpful - always patient and always with a smile. My room, which was comfortable and spacious, was on the second floor, had a small balcony which overlooked a pretty square in the Plaka. The stairs were not a problem and I enjoyed my view. On each floor is a small kitchen where a continental breakfast was served which I took to my room and enjoyed on the balcony - a lovely way to start the day. I certainly appreciated that coffee, tea, fruit, cookies, were available at all times in the kitchen area. Breakfast was fine and only my suggestion would be to offer some delicious Greek pastries and rolls and fresh squeezed orange juice from those incredibly wonderful Greek oranges.Highly recommended","June 25, 2018","26    Palladian Home

The position of the hotel is ideal- right in the heart of Plaka with the square of lovely restaurants right down below. Everything is so incredibly close and we walked all around Plaka, the street markets, the Acropolis, national Gardens, Anafiotika, Hadrian’s Arch etc etc with no trouble whatsoever! We found the two gentlemen at the front so friendly and helpful- they organized our taxi to the port the next morning too, and the room was perfect for us- very clean, and we loved the lively vibe from the restaurants down below (we didn’t find noise to be an issue in the slightest at night). We also loved the self service kitchen that was stocked with coffee, biscuits, fruit, bread and cereal, which you could help yourself to at any time. This really came in handy as we had to leave really early to catch our ferry the next morning and so we could still eat something before we left :) we highly recommend the Palladian home!

This is a boutique hotel, so expectations are that the dimensions are going to be small, however no matter as you're not in Athens to sit in your room. The room and bathroom are very comfortable, everything was clean and there was complementary water too. Wi-fi was a bit slow (again though, not here to sit on the internet), but definitely not a deal-breaker. Also no outside news which was niceThe metro is about 5-10 minute walk away, very easy to get to and The Acropolis (which is right next to the metro) and Temple of Zeus is about the same distance, although in different directions.I'd recommend this hotel and would stay here again as the location is perfect.","June 18, 2018","26    Palladian Home

Breakfast included cold cut meat, cheeses, bread, variety of pastries, and fruits (both fresh and dried).  Property is close to tourist attractions and public transportation which is also a major plus. However, if you are a light sleeper this proximity to restaurants/bars, could be a problem at night. Additionally, as charming as the building is with its hard wood floors and tall ceilings, noise can be echoed from other units doors opening/closing in the hallway or during breakfast prep in the morning. Honestly though, for us overall this place had more charm than any minor issues that could bother us. Therefore, we would certainly recommend staying at this property during your stay in Athens.

1505,We have stayed at the Electra Palace many times. The location and elegance of this hotel is wonderful. The rooms are lovely and the junior suite gives you extra room for longer stays. The breakfast is good but not the best for a 5 Star hotel. Compared to other 5 Star hotels in Greece it's not a unique experience but adequate. The service staff in the restaurant and houskekeeping are very nice and friendly. We found this year that the reception staff weren't as friendly as past years. Very unusual for Greek hotels. We still give this hotel a 5 star rating and will be back next year!,"June 12, 2019","27    Electra Palace Athens

1506,"Generally almost everything was ok: Great location, Nice Loby, Friendly staff, Cleanliness, ComfortNothing was really bad. However, for the price we paid and our expectations based on reviews, we were a bit disappointed. Room size was rather small based on our former experience in 5 stars hotels. A coffee machine was missing in the room. The lighting in the room was inadequate. Wall coating needs replacement or at least a refreshment. Size of bathroom was ok, and toiletry was rich. However It was uncomfortable: When the door was open it was uncomfortable to stand at the sink, The location of the toilet is not optimal, It's hard to shower in the bathtub without wetting the floor next to it.","June 11, 2019","27    Electra Palace Athens

1508,I can’t really give the hotel a bad rating because I didn’t get to stay there. Our flight to Athens was overbooked and we were bumped from the flight. I called Expedia right away so they could notify the hotel of our dilemma. Electra Palace denied the cancellation and any refund. This was totally out of our control and quite frankly very unfair. ,"June 4, 2019","27    Electra Palace Athens

The rooms though were quite compact which made it difficult at times to open your suitcases easily. Also limited PowerPoints in the room. Breakfast was very nice and plenty of choices.

1511,"My wife, son, and I stayed at the Electra Palace Hotel last week. What a lovely hotel! Service was outstanding and breakfast was much better than one would expect at a buffet. Great pool but perhaps a bit small and with not enough loungers. Did have an EXCEPTIONAL view of the Parathion. Walk-able for most all significant Athens sites. Service at the front desk was outstanding. Room bed was very comfy and the shower was great. Could use a bit more room in the dresser or another place to put clothes. Breakfast is the only meal we ate here and both the pool bar as well as the breakfast are top rate. Employees were very kind and got us off and running to our early morning ferry in great speed. Good drinks at the rooftop bar and pool area. Water was pretty cold in the pool could use to be heated in the early season. All in all a very very good to outstanding hotel. If you can swing it get one of the higher up rooms with a balcony and view of the Acropolis.","May 29, 2019","27    Electra Palace Athens

The air conditioning worked very well. No complaints. The breakfast was wonderful. The view of the Acropolis from our balcony and the pool/bar area was spectacular!

No more than 10 mins walk from most of the tourist attractions and bars/restaurants.Hotel is beautiful and the breakfast is substantial - my son particularly enjoyed the waffle machine! We didn't eat at the hotel in the evenings but the menu looked good and reasonably priced.I am an Electra Rewards member and my only slight negative was that this wasn't recognised on check in. When I mentioned it later (we were very tired at checkin due to late flight so I didn't register at first!) the staff member was apologetic and said there were 2 records set up for me for some reason. He then gave me a voucher for a welcome drink to be used at any time during our stay. As one of the benefits is room allocation however, I do wonder if we would have had a better view or room away from the lift if all had gone smoothly.The outdoor pool is a bonus - amazing view - but as we went in April it wasn't really warm enough to use comfortably so we used the indoor pool which was also very nice, if a bit warm!We would stay here again if visiting Athens, and I would definitely recommend it to friends/family.

The double room was as expected, small but not that it became a problem for two people to negotiate, the bathroom offering a bath/shower and the usual products, bathrobe and slippers. We enjoyed our visit to the indoor pool and jacuzzi, but did not partake in the use of the gym or spa facilities. During our stay we never actually ate at the restaurant on the fifth floor, but going through it gives you access to a veranda and outdoor pool and of course a spectacular view of the Acropolis.

I was lucky enough to get upgraded to a suite with Acropolis views which was well, just WOW! Thanks to the staff for that amazing surprise. But that aside this is a lovely hotel, beautifully decorated (smells great when you walk into the lobby!) and the staff are all really friendly. It’s not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. I stayed at another hotel downtown after this and it was no where near as good.

We used the spa everyday which was a great way to wind down after lots of walking around the city and the spa manager was so professional and friendly. The roof top bar had amazing views of the city and especially the Acropolis - it was a shame that tis had really yet to open for the summer season. Breakfast was buffet style and the choice was endless.

Check in was quick, thorough and in addition, as a member of the Electra loyalty scheme I was granted access to the premier wifi and given a voucher for two free drinks at the hotel bar. I shared a twin room with a friend (room 518) which was perfect for our stay. The room had all the facilities you would expect in a hotel of this quality. The beds were comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean. The room was serviced well and the turn down service left a very welcome chocolate on our beds each night- thanks!Our room looked out onto adjoining buildings but we didn't go to Athens to look out of the hotel window. Having said that. we were only a few feet away from the entrance to the rooftop terrace which overlooks the Acropolis. Great for enjoying the February sunshine on the Sunday afternoon. The rooftop pool is closed till April, but the indoor pool is open and when I went for my swim on Sunday at 1.30pm I was the only person in it - bliss!The hotel is set away from the main streets but is in a great location for all the major sights of Athens. We found it very easy to walk to all of these to enjoy the most of Athens. I made breakfast on two of our three days there. On offer was everything you could expect, both hot and cold as well as a low fat counter of foods for those watching the calories! Great and tasty choices. Thanks to all at the hotel for a very enjoyable stay and I will definitely choose to stay with you again in the future.

For breakfast, there was plenty of choice and it was good quality. The decor throughout the hotel was lovely. On many trips, one uses the hotel to sleep, but we actually spent quite a bit of time hanging out there -- in the garden, in the bar (where we had a snack one evening because we were too tired to go out) and in our room -- by choice because the atmosphere was so comfortable and welcoming.","February 12, 2019","27    Electra Palace Athens

Although the room wasn't large, it was on par with a luxury hotel, very clean and loaded with all the amenities. The location is the best anyone can get. A quite street but still right in the center and walking distance to all the most important locations.

We had a suite with a terrace from which we could view Hadrian's Arch and a part of the Acropolis. We were able to walk to many places easily. The kitchen was perfect for chilling our wine and having fresh fruits and other snacks on hand. The bed was quite comfortable.

1549,"We chose this hotel because of it’s location & were very pleased with the accommodations & service. With taxes & fees it was around $400/night, which is comparable to other nice hotels in major cities. Hadrian’s Arch & the Temple of Zeus are basically outside the door. It is less than 5 min walk to the Acropolis & 2 minutes from tourist shopping. The National Gardens, Panhellenic stadium, & Parliament are with 15 minutes of walking. They kindly arranged our transportation from the airport & delivered sparkling wine when we arrived. It would be nice if a light breakfast could be added to the room earlier than the main breakfast (not included), as tours start earlier than breakfast begins in Athens. This neighborhood is very crowded, but not loud. Rooms were quiet large & nicely decorated.","July 5, 2019","28    AVA Hotel Athens

1550,"If it’s your first time to Athens, like it was for us, Ava hotel is perfectly positioned in the Plaka area. It’s right at the beginning of Lysikratous street facing Hadrian’s Arch. The Acropolis is a couple of streets behind and Syntagma Square is a 10 min walk. As is Monastiraki. Unbeatable location! We visited in the peak visitor season (July) and peak of the summer temperatures too. Luckily as our flight from London landed in the afternoon, the room was available immediately (check in time is 2:30pm). The chilled white they comped on our arrival was a wonderful relief in the heat of Athens. We were a family of three - 2 adults and a teenager so we took a room with an additional bed. There was a basic kitchenette in the room and a little balcony. Everything was clean and welcoming and met all our needs, without appearing too basic. The bathroom was well stocked with supplies, hairdryer etc. The bathroom door didn’t lock initially but we obtained a key. Breakfast was tasty and more than adequate although not the huge global spread that fancier hotels provide - two kinds of eggs, toast, baked goods, a choice of cold cuts / sausages, grilled veggies, salad, Greek yoghurt and cheeses, and fruits, juices, coffee and tea. The staff here are wonderful, going out of their way to help out and to advise. From adapters to reservations to early morning packed breakfasts, they handled every sort of request. If you’re looking for a place that is conveniently located for all sightseeing I would highly recommend this hotel. ","July 4, 2019","28    AVA Hotel Athens

They ordered a taxi for an early morning airport transfer, printed out our next flight’s boarding passes, and helped book a tour of the acropolis for us. They also have a good selection of books and movies (movies upon request) in the lobby. We were given champagne the day we checked in.

1554,"Athens was the last stop on my wife's 75th Birthday Tour (also called the No Regrets Tour) where we went back to old favorites. We'd been to Athens twice before but wanted to do it properly.The Ava Hotel was the perfect solution for us. The Executive Suite is roomy (559 sq ft), modern, exceptionally clean, and has a balcony that has Hardian's Arch (and the Temple of Zeus) out one side and the Acropolis out the other.The facilities are great, but the people are better. They were always on top of making our vacation run the way we wanted it to. Great attitudes, big smiles, and great information.The Executive Suite has a full kitchen and a workspace just inside the door, and a dining bar with seating for four. It then goes into a sizable living room and an equally spacious bedroom. And then, of course, the balcony. The balcony does not have furniture on it. but we found that the chairs by the bar would fit just fine...The bathroom has a nice rain forest shower and two sinks. In the ceiling was a large circular painting. Very pretty.Breakfast is served daily. It's pretty well rounded, mostly buffet, but they will cook eggs to order. I'd didn't push beyond that... They do not serve dinner, but you can order from room service. We did that one night, waited over an hour (they warned us), and saw the food delivery guy drop off our food. Thankfully, it was still warm.We asked them to arrange airport transfers and a private guide for us. They arranged for a young lady named Helen to take us to the Acropolis. My wife had taken a bad fall earlier in the vacation (but kept motoring on) so we were a little slow. There is an elevator that goes to the top and is available only for disabled people with a letter from their doctor and prior approval. Somehow, Helen managed to get us on. Thanks again, Helen!!We thought that the location was exceptional. As I may have mentioned before ;-)) Hadrian's Arch is a block in one direction, and in the other direction is the base of the Acropolis. Two blocks up is a pedestrian zone with an incredible collection of stores and restaurants and people. Mixed in the obligatory T-Shirt shops are leather stores, high end clothing, many types of food - including gelato!!!, outdoor cafes, and small parks. All in all, a great time at a great hotel in a fantastic location!","June 19, 2019","28    AVA Hotel Athens

As well as a comfortable sitting area, there was a fully equipped kitchenette and a bathroom with both a bath with shower and a separate shower cubicle. Everything was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was generously varied for a hotel that has only 9 rooms (we think) and consisted of slightly different pastries, fruit, cheese, breads and eggs every day, all set out very nicely with the same attentive service.

1565,"My daughter and I stayed at AVA Hotel & Suites in Athens in April, 2019. I rarely write a review but sometimes a hotel is so outstanding that I feel compelled to do so. AVA Hotel is definitely that type of outstanding place! I can honestly say that there is not one negative aspect to this hotel! The location is perfect if you wish to visit all of the ancient sites in Athens. All of the top sites are within walking distance of the hotel (5-10 minutes walk at the most). The hotel is located in the Plaka District which is very safe to walk around and has many wonderful restaurants also within walking distance. Plus, the hotel is located on a small side-street which is very quiet. You will not hear road traffic in your room! The suites at the AVA are beautifully designed and quite large. There is plenty of room to relax both inside or on your balcony. The views are magical both during the day and at night! Housekeeping does an excellent job and the rooms are spotlessly clean. Thank you to the housekeeping staff! A breakfast is served in the common area near the lobby each morning and has wonderful Greek favorites along with eggs and other dishes which can be served free to you. The Greek yogurt with honey and Greek salad were our favorites along with some Greek pastries made fresh each morning from a sweet and kind woman from the kitchen staff. The best part of the hotel is that every person on staff was as kind, caring, and helpful as possible. They always went out of their way to get us answers to questions, offered advice on restaurants and things to do, made reservations.....but always with a smile and cheerful response. Whenever we arrived back at the hotel we were greeted with a genuine smile and a question about how our day was going. Everyone made us feel like we were friends and we would like to especially thank Vassia, Andreea, Lambrini, and Stravos for their kind help. Thank you to everyone at AVA Hotel & Suites for making our stay in Greece such a wonderful experience! Next time we visit Athens we will definitely stay here.

Our taxi driver commented when he dropped us off from the airport that we had the perfect location and he was right!We had a view out one side of our balcony of the Acropolis, the other side features Hadrian’s Arch and the Temple of Zeus. We could walk two blocks and be in the midst of the Plaka pedestrian streets with all the shopping and restaurants and yet close our window to our hotel room and not hear anything from outside. The executive suite set up was ideal for a family of four with a king size bed for the parents and the kids had a single and a double to fight over in the living room. The bathroom was big and clean; and the kitchenette meant we could go out to get breakfast and eat it in our room rather than pay the 15 euro pp for the hotel breakfast.Lamprini at the front desk was like having a private concierge - she arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport and several dinner reservations.We highly recommend AVA to anyone visiting Athens to see the major sights!","April 15, 2019","28    AVA Hotel Athens

It may just be that I have had the experience of staying in several other hotels in Athens, and for the price (almost $300 USD!), I found this hotel to be far below my expectations. It was the most expensive and yet the most average hotel I have stayed at in Athens. The location is excellent, but the customer service is sub-par, the beds and pillows are not particularly comfortable, the towels are old and stiff and the room (especially the bathroom) is fairly out-dated. The website is beautiful--boasting luxurious suites and a roof top view of the acropolis. Neither of which is the case.

There was a small fridge in the room ideal for storing soft drinks, fruit or cold meats and cheese for making a sandwich should you not have the inclination to eat in a restaurant.The hotel serves a breakfast with the possibility to have eggs sausage and bacon with the usual continental breakfast of cold meats, cheeses, rolls toast and jam. The choice is adequate but is not as vast as is found in the larger 5 star luxury hotels, This was not a problem for my wife and I or I would imagine the vast majority of guests.The hotel does not serve lunch or dinner but there a number of restaurants 5 minutes walk away with facilities to cook or make sandwiches in the room should you wish not to eat out twice a day and are staying for a more extended period than the short break we took.Staff were friendly and eager and able to give advice regarding local shopping and sightseeing. Service overall was excellent and the rooms and hotel lobby and breakfast room scrupulously clean.There is a small room adjacent to the lobby with a computer and printer where I was able to print out my boarding card prior to my flight back to the UK.The hotel is centrally placed in Plaka within walking distance of The Acropolis, The Acropolis Museum, The Temple of Zeus, Panathenaic Stadium, and The Parliament Building at Syntagma Square, all of which we were able to visit in one day.

This hotel is in the PERFECT location in Plaka, between the Hadrian Arch and the Acropolis. Most of the tourist attractions that you want to see in Athens are close to the hotel, saving you taxi money. And, as if that were not enough, the rooms are suites, that is, you have a living room, kitchenette with eating counter, a nice and modern bathroom, and a nice and spacious bedroom. (Our suite was an executive suite, 52 sq.mt. The regular rooms are basic suites of 32 sq.mt.) All very pleasant, modern, and clean. I could not believe my eyes when I opened the door to our room.The hotel is small (called a boutique hotel) and one would never expect it to be so great. But great it was, including the very friendly, informative, and professional staff. We did not partake of the daily breakfast offered by the hotel for an additional $15/day. Due to its great location, the hotel is surrounded by a myriad of restaurants and eating establishments, a few open as early as 6:00 a.m., and for a lesser price, you can enjoy a great breakfast. Ask the staff for dinner recommendations as Plaka is full of great little restaurants. Also close by are rental car companies.I will be a returning customer the next time I visit Athens.

Breakfast was satisfactory with the food catering for most tastes.

The foldout couch was comfortable, without the notorious bar showing through the mattress. Bathroom had a tub & separate shower. Kitchen had a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee pot.The front desk folks were great...very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.

1582,"We stayed at Ava 5 nights in early Oct. It is the perfect hotel to use as a home base for day trips in the city of Athens and to the surrounding countryside (Corinth Canal, Myceanea, Mystros). It is located between Hadrian's Arch and The Acropolis. If you have an executive room, as our travel companions did, you'll have a view of both. Our room had a ""city view"" which was really the back of other apartments but fine as we were really on in our room a limited amount of time. The room was clean, bed was very comfortable and space was large enough for the 2 of us and lots of luggage. It was nice to have the kitchen to make tea, coffee and warm up leftovers from the fabulous local Plaka restaurants. Don't miss Psaras for an incredible view and dinner. Also Athena Bistro, both recommended by the hotel. Hotel staff was very accommodating and warmly welcomed us. Nice assortment of breakfast foods from eggs and bacon to cold cuts and cheeses, yogurt, oatmeal, waffles, juices, cold cereal, rolls and pastries.Our only complaint would be that we needed a blanket not just a sheet and thin bed spread.All 4 in our party would highly recommend the Ava.","October 26, 2018","28    AVA Hotel Athens

1586,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel in October. The staff are very friendly and helpful in providing directions, restaurant suggestions and transfer help. The hotel has a pretty nice DVD library that is free of charge. As others have said, having the breakfast included is nice, and the food quality is good, but limited. If your rate does not include breakfast, I wouldn't recommend paying extra for it, as there are lots of cafe's/restaurants around the hotel. The hotel location is great for sightseeing! It is located in the La Plaka area of Athens, which is the historical section of the city, so it's a great home base for shops/restaurants and seeing the historical sights. The rooms themselves are large, spacious and comfortable, however they feel a bit dated, especially the bathroom. There was a kitcheonette with working stove in the room, so was nice to have, even though we didn't use it. All the pictures of this hotel are for people that paid for the Acropolis view. The city view is not glamorous at all, it's actually more of a wall view. If staying at this hotel, make sure you pay for the Acropolis view. While the hotel website gives the perception that there is a rooftop lunge, there really isn't so be careful of having this expectation. There are many restaurants and lounges within a 1 block radius that offer a nice rooftop view of the acropolis though.","October 10, 2018","28    AVA Hotel Athens

This is an outstanding Boutique Hotel in the Plaka area of Athens. Plaka is part of the old town with narrow streets, sidewalk cafes, and within walking distance to the Acropolis.

For starters, I had some difficulty finding a hotel that would accommodate the size of our family, and one that allowed young children. The Ava was honestly a perfect choice!! We stayed in the Executive Suite which had a king size bed in a bedroom with doors that closed, and included a pack and playfor my 1 year old. Then the living room had a pull out couch and a chair that turned into a single bed. The space was perfect for our family and I would HIGHLY recommend it for families. We had a great view of the temple of Zeus and the Parthenon from our balcony off of the living room, a large bathroom and small kitchenette area. The location was also ideal as we were right in the middle of Plaka with access to tons of restaurants and shops. And down the block we were able to get the hop on hop off bus to see the city sites.

1604,"We stayed here for 3 nights, very happy about (almost) everything. Quite a pleasant surprise.LocationVery close to Syntagma Square, 3-5min walk. Many Athens tours have pick up at the hotel or at nearby hotels within 3-5min walk. Lots of restaurants and shops, pharmacy around the hotel. We walked to The Temple Zeus one morning, only 10min away. You can also walk to The Acropolis Museum in about 10min and explore the interesting neighbourhood there. ServiceVery impressed by the staff: they really tried very hard to go out of their way to help us with everything1. Airport pick upWe emailed the hotel asking for airport pick up. They charge about 49 euro. Our driver was waiting for us around mid night at the airport with our name sign. Felt very secure with our professional, English speaking driver. Much better than jumping into a random taxi around mid night2. Staff onsiteThe hotel room key did not work well (the very few “complain” I have for the hotel). Whenever I came down to re-cut the key, the front desk always sent someone up with me to make sure the new key would work. The new key did not work in one of those trips, the bell boy offered to run down to the lobby to get another new new key for me. Although the key situation was a bit annoying, the attitude of everyone trying very hard to help made this more “livable”I was up early one night due to jet lag. Went downstairs to read in the lobby. After a while, the front deck staff asked if I would like some coffee. He then asked the service staff to make fresh coffee for me, free of charge, at very early hours in the morning (before 5am)! 3. RoomWe had 2 adjacent rooms for our party. The room is not fancy but very clean, functioned well. Size is more than adequate for up to 2 people each room. Shower is clean, AC worked really well. We were here during a heat wave, on our last day, there was a power blackout in the entire neighbourhood. The light was on but AC and elevator stopped working. The hotel offered to send bell boy to our room on the 9th floor to help with luggage (luckily the power came back before we checked out). 4. Rooftop restaurant/barThe outside patio of the rooftop restaurant faces The Acropolis. It has a direct view of sunset, but not sunrise (The Acropolis is on the west of the hotel). Breakfast has many selections, nothing fancy but more than enough to choose from. It’s included in our booking. Dinner at the restaurant Ned reservation due to the popular view. But the bar next door accepts walk in. Definitely worth having a drink there before sunsetToursWe did not rent our own car. Instead we booked tours through Viator. Athens is HOT during the summer. We tried to avoid being out there whole day especially mid day. We did the half day Athens tour in the morning, with The Acropolis Museum pass. From 8:30am-1:30pm. You can get to the Acropolis earlier if you go on your own but it’s nice to have a guide telling the history of the city. Expect A LOT of people at The Acropolis, A LOT!! But you can not leave Athens without seeing the Acropolis, so it’s worth it. Make sure to take your sunscreen and water. We then took a MUCH needed break in our cool room in the afternoon. We joined a sunset Cape Sounion and Temple of Poseidon tour from 4:30pm-10:30pm. Highly recommend this tour. It’s magical to watch sunset at the Temple of Poseidon.We debated between Olympia vs Delphi, decided to go to Delphi. Olympia might be too much for a day tour from Athens. It was such a hot day that it was very difficult to enjoy anything. The tour was from 8:30am - 7:30pm. If you have to see something outside Athens, this is one of the options. Be aware it can be REALLY hot in Delphi. Our tour guide told us it’s typical for the Greeks to have lunch around 2:30pm. It took us +3 hours to get to Delphi, just before noon (with coffee and restroom break at a really nice coffee house). We toured the Temple of Apollo, the Stadium and the museum. We had lunch at Taverna Vakchos. It was recommended by Rick Steve’s Greece. Food was reasonably priced, service was fast, can be friendlier but the view is stunning!

It even brands a centuries old church right outside the main entrance (the enormous building has engulfed the tiny church and was previously criticized for that).Top floor restaurant and bar offers stunning views of the Acropolis.The only minus is that the nearest metro stations are several hundred meters away and not so easily accessed with luggage; even taxis struggle in the one-way labyrinth of down-town Athens and take an extra 5-10 mins to get out of it.It is however a very popular addition in the upscale segment and therefore often fully booked or very pricey.","June 20, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

The hotel is located in a prime area on a street full of nice restaurants and close to the Plaka and Syntagma Square.

The rooftop restaurant has great views of the Acropolis and serves free breakfast with lots of choices (waffles, pancakes, bread, eggs, meat, juices, yogurt, pudding, fresh fruits and many more). The outdoor swimming pool was big and uncrowded most of the time.The biggest issue I had with the hotel was the service. Some of the staff at the reception and in the restaurant weren’t necessarily the friendliest while a few others were friendly and helpful.

1616,"The property is beautiful. Very well located. Nice rooms. The service however is erratic, they have someone come and check on how your check in was which is awesome but on the other hand it almost feels like you are imposing on staff if you ask a question at the reception. The rooftop is just beautiful but then again service is poor. The staff will avoid eye contact. They won’t come ask you if you need another drink or anything....... maybe I am spoilt by service one is used to in the US. They have a long way to go on service ...... but beautiful hotel indeed.","June 16, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

1617,"Im not sure how this hotel rates so highly and for the price it is even worse - its very overpriced for a dated property. This review comes from the perspective of staying in four hotels in Athens including this one across a 2 month period.We had a bad experience from the moment we booked through checkin and our entire stay. Our room looked strait into someone elses apartment which didnt help (and so would anyone staying on most floors given the surrounding buildings except the highest ones), but also he staff werent the greatest and the room was dated, breakfast was average and generally it just wasnt a good place to stay.I strongly suggest looking at other properties - we stayed at the Perianth Hotel and Hotel Blend before and after our stay at the Electra and they were far superior. Again not sure how it rates well and i feel let down that i followed the reviews of others. I wouldn't recommend to anyone - even if the rooms were cheap.","June 13, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

Very close to Syntagma Square, Plaka district, great shopping, restaurants and major sites in Athens. Our room on the 9th floor was spacious, with nice amenities, had comfortable beds and a great rain head shower. The lighting was good as well. I am an Electra Rewards member and a small gift and sparkling water was delivered to our room. We also received complimentary drinks and snacks at the rooftop bar. Nice touch! The staff provided excellent customer service and were friendly. The restaurant and bar on the 10th floor had amazing views of the Acropolis!

From the moment we checked in, everything was perfect! The hotel is modern yet grand (but not too much so) our room was lovely, spacious & immaculate. Everyone of the staff was helpful, polite and eager to please to make our stay more enjoyable. Breakfast had everything you could want but seeing no poached eggs, asked if I could have some and they were delivered to the table a couple of minutes later. We ate in the hotel restaurant a few times. It has fab views, the menu was excellent, so was the wine, and the service was just right. Attentive but not standing over us or constantly refilling our glasses. We enjoyed our evening dinners and couldn’t find any fault at all! A fantastic experience and, should we ever return, we will return to the Electra Metropolis - full marks for everyone. Thank you.","June 2, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

1626,"The Electra Metropolis located just 230 metres from Syntagma Square (city centre) at 15 Mitropoleos, Athens exudes contemporary elegance and understated style. It promises an experience of discreet luxury infused with a retro-chić aesthetic and a 1960s feel. On the 10th floor, the Metropolis roof garden serves breakfast, lunch and dinner based on modern fusion Greek cuisine. The hotel Offers 216 rooms including classic, superior, executive, deluxe, suites and Acropolis view suites. Rooms and suites are modern with hints of a traditional ode to Greece. The team are warm, friendly, engaging and professional. Customer service is at the forefront and centre of everything they do. The hotel and hospitality has exceeded our expectations.

1628,"Unfortunately, there are significant legal loopholes allowing hotels and airlines to refuse to honor ""mistake"" fares despite the fact that they routinely play games with published rates in order to manipulate business. However, responsible operations generally honor posted rates, especially after a confirmation is issued, and even the less scrupulous generally cancel ""mistake"" reservations quickly. I just received a cancellation from the Electra over a month after I received the initial confirmation for a prepaid rate. I would highly recommend not booking this hotel, as you cannot assume the booking will be honored!","May 22, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

1629,"Overall horrible stay. Our room was so small the luggage wouldn’t fit, we asked to pay for an upgrade they said the hotel was fully booked though on Booking.com all sorts of rooms were available. The shower was broken, nothing was done and water pressure was awful, our coffee mugs were replaced by dirty ones. On the last day we had to leave at 6.15am and we asked if could have just some fruit for breakfast, which starts at 6.30 am and again staff was unhelpful. The worst part is that we were in our honeymoon and there were so many opportunities for them to show a five star service and on ALL opportunities they failed. It was extremely disappointing and it totally spoiled our good vibes. Oh, they didn’t even meet our minimum expectations so definitely don’t stay here if you are expecting special treatment as honeymooners.On the bright side location is great and the view from the restaurant is breathtaking.","May 19, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

1630,"This was a hotel that I was quite happy with. The location is great and it was easy to get around everywhere. Tons of restaurants, cafes, shopping areas and historical landmarks are nearby.The view of the Acropolis from the restaurant, both day and night is incredible. Its the type of view that you can never get sick of. I had my breakfast there in the mornings and drinks during the evening. The drink menu is pretty good. The rooms are spacious and cleaned well. It was a quite comfortable stay. The overall decor of the hotel was pretty cool and trendy, without overdoing it.The spa was just ok. But to be honest, I'm a spa snob. So it takes an awful lot to get a solid 2 thumbs up for a spa from me.The staff were great! When I checked in, I realized that I left my phone in the car that picked me up from the airport. They went thru great lengths to get in touch with the driver to return my phone. I booked my transfer thru Electra, and I must say they use an excellent car transportation company too. Whenever I was passing in the lobby, the staff were always pleasant, either remembering me by name or welcoming me with a big smile. This is the type of service I look for in hotels. Had a very pleasant stay and would stay there again.","May 16, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

1631,"The location was ideal for walking around the city and the view from the hotel rooftop was stunning but beyond that, there was nothing else redeemable about my experience here. Without exaggeration, this was the absolute worst customer service in a hotel I’ve ever experienced. Upon check in, there was confusion about my guest’s name being on the reservation despite me being the one who made the booking with my credit card and presenting ID on check in. The front desk clerk refused to check me in until I removed my guest’s name from the reservation on booking.com (even though I explained that she wasn’t flying in for another 2 days) and he refused to help me do this, telling me I needed to go online on my phone right there to do it. After I did this, he then told me my room would be ready in 30 minutes (which was fine since I was arriving before the 2 pm check in) and he told me to have a seat and that he would let me know when the room was ready. I waited 30 minutes and when no one came to get me, I went to the front desk and found him standing around just chatting with his colleagues. He looked up at me and said “oh yes, you’re room is ready”. He had clearly forgotten I was waiting to be notified. I’d just gotten off a transatlantic flight. I was tired and anxious to get settled. He never offered a simple apology for forgetting about me. I would've been able to overlook this rocky start however there was an even bigger transgression regarding my friend's luggage when she arrived 2 days later. Her luggage was unfortunately delayed and had to be delivered to the hotel. The female staff member that she spoke with at the front desk assured my guest it would be accepted by staff when it got there and even copied her luggage tag receipts to be sure that she had all the correct information. Imagine our surprise when the delivery service called us while we were at dinner and said that the hotel told them that my friend checked out of the hotel two days prior and was now at a new hotel! Clearly this story made no sense so she called the hotel who admitted they sent it away mistakenly but had already rearranged for it to be delivered again later that evening (at this point it was after 9 pm). When we got back from dinner, we went to the front desk to see what was going on. The first man we spoke with told us it was sent away because the luggage being delivered wasn’t the correct bag and that it was the bag of someone with the same last name but a different first name. He told us that no one from the hotel ever told the delivery service that my friend had checked out already and they didn’t know why the delivery service would say that, essentially accusing them of lying to us. That story made even less sense than the original story we were told so we asked to speak with the night manager, Pavlos. Pavlos then told us that there was no confusion over the name on the bag (completely contradicting what the other staff member told us only minutes earlier) but that the bag was sent away because “well her name wasn’t on the reservation so we sent them away”. Nevermind the fact that her name WAS on the reservation upon check in two days prior and was only removed after I was told I HAD to remove it in order for me to check in. Pavlos told us that removing a guest name wasn’t policy, now implying that I was lying. He said even if I had been told to remove her name from the original reservation, her name wasn’t on the reservation currently and they couldn’t be expected to check through the paperwork to find her luggage tag receipt that was left at the desk because they were “too busy”. He actually told us that it was too much of a bother to check the paperwork that their staff asked for in the first place to confirm that the bag being delivered was correct. Throughout this entire exchange, Pavlos only apologized after about 10 minutes, but only after I pointed out that he still had not, in fact, offered us an apology for the error and such an extreme inconvenience. Unbelievably, I had to make him offer an apology but he freely told us numerous times throughout our exchange that the hotel was not at fault and that it was both the delivery service’s fault and also our fault for not having her name on the reservation. At one point while I was speaking to him, he rudely interrupted me to ask when I would be checking out! I felt incredibly dismissed and felt as though he was telling me that he was tired of speaking with us. My friend’s bag, which was expected around 6:30 pm, didn’t get delivered to our room until 6 am, just two hours before we needed to check out for a flight to Mykonos! Completely outrageous. The staff from my check in experience to the missing bag fiasco was completely disinterested in any sort of warmth or hospitality and when a mistake clearly on the part of the hotel occurred, we were lied to and told numerous stories, blamed for the mistake and told repeatedly that the hotel was not at fault. The attitude that came across from the staff was very much “this is a tourist area, so you need us, not the other way around”. This was a terrible start to our vacation, and my birthday which was part of the reason for the trip, and completely marred by impression of Athens. I cannot believe that one of the most expensive hotels in the city would have such cold, apathetic staff working there. To be absolutely clear, this was my first and last experience with an Electra property and I will never patronize one again.","May 14, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

Our little one enjoyed Athens especially because of the attentive staff who made sure to greet her every morning with a smile and make her feel at home. The views from this hotel our breathtaking and we enjoyed waking up every morning to eat breakfast and admire the view of the Acropolis. Our room was spacious enough for a family of three and room service came twice a day and always stocked our room with items. Breakfast was good and suitable for us since we were up early thanks to our child, however keep in mind they close at buffet at 10 am which is early for some. We spent our days shopping and eating at the restaurants which are all walking distance. We always felt safe but keep in mind when traveling anywhere to take precautions. What we enjoyed most as a family was the heated pool and spa.Also, the staff here is so friendly and gave us useful information since we were interested in going to Santorini for a day and arranged a taxi. If your planning to stay here with your family and enjoy your vacation I would highly recommend this hotel.

The rooms are well set up for the business traveller. Plenty of light. Small balcony and can open windows for fresh air. Reliable internet. The desk chair was too low so the hotel arranged an adjustable office chair for me to be able to work in the room. The bathroom is well appointed, modern and functional. The housekeeping staff are invariably polite and thorough. Overall, I find the staff consistently demonstrates that nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast continues to be outstanding and the Acropolis views superb. Congratulations.","February 28, 2019","29    Electra Metropolis Hotel

1653,"We have stayed here previously and it has been great but this visit was mildly disastrous. I am working overseas and my husband made the booking for a romantic catchup. He emailed it to me but when I arrived 7 hours before he flew in, the reception clerk would not let me in the room, despite clear documentation of the payment and the booking until my husband verified it. I explained he was in the air but they shrugged and said there was nothing they could do, so my long awaited shower was still hours away...Finally when he arrived I was allowed into the room. The balcony door lock was broken so a man with a drill arrived and pulled it apart to repair it. Then the toilet wouldn’t stop flushing and maintenance came again but the fix only lasted for a few hours and it’s now not flushing at all. Normally I’d ask for an upgrade, complain etc but you know what? I’m just going to leave, never come back and warn others that this hotel is not what it used to be.

I called the hotel, and he immediately called the cab company to tell them to wait for us.When we got to the hotel, we were welcomed warmly and checked into our room.

1662,"Stayed here for 2nights. This place requires some consideration before booking. Positives: the room is spacious and clean with pleasant decor. Conveniently located to restaurants, bars, metro station & Acropolis. Free water and Nespresso machine are handy. Negatives: we had very early mornings, the hotel lady told us the day before she would pre pack us breakfast as b’fast starts 7:30am. She did not communicate where she would leave the package. Whether it would be brought to our room, left in the b’fast section or reception. Next morning, b’fast couldn’t be found in any of those locations. When raised with the hotel lady next day. She vehemently maintained she left it in the b’fast section. When she heard me say to my partner I’d speak to her manager. We found her come to our room with a bottle of wine as consolation. We also arrived in the evening to an unlocked room with the door open. Nothing was missing however, makes you wonder how careless the cleaning staff are !? The safe in our room was locked to begin with and to operate it required speaking to the staff. We were not keen. On the final morning of checkout there was definitely a b’fast pack. Guess they try to rectify issues.Generally don’t bother reviewing sub par stays. But the above are facts from our stay.","May 30, 2019","30    18 Micon Str.

This place combines service and comfort to its best ! A place where there is a great coffee machine , plain water and waterwith mint & cucumbers, tasty cookies at the finger tips of the hotel guests any time of day and night, a huge fridge with goodies again for hotel guests on top of the coffee and bottle of water placed in your room everyday! We stayed in the urban jetted tub room,which was just at its best! Spacious room with all modern amenities. Breakfast was tasty though similar continental items but I loved it. Staff are just amazing and super friendly and they provide genuine service as they listen to you which impressed me so much ! They even pack delicious breakfast in case you are leaving earlier than breakfast time! You can get island hopping tour or any other tour booked from the hotel which was convinient as well Location is brilliant as it's Athens downtown, 5 mins from Monsteraki square where you will have market, metro access and meeting point for all 3 hop on and hop off bus!!Definitely visit the Mary Poppins themed cocktail and dessert cafe 'The Knook', as for food you will be very spoilt for choicbut definitely indulge in Greek Souvlaki and Lamb Gyros if we eat meat!! recommend this place to everyone!","May 27, 2019","30    18 Micon Str.

1664,"Our 4 night stay at Micon St was a pleasure. We split our time between two rooms, the loft which had a view of the acropolis and a double room. We enjoyed the view from the balcony of the loft but be warned, there is a spiral staircase from the elevator to the actual sleeping area where the loft is located. It was a bit of a problem moving our luggage through the narrow spiral staircase. If you have any disability this is not the room for you. Other than this one surprise, we loved everything about the hotel. The rooms are thoughtful with modern decor, extremely clean, welcoming and in a great location. We were able to walk to the acropolis, monastraki Square, the plaka district and many restaurants and shopping stores within a few minutes. Michael greeted us upon arrival and was a pleasure. He offered some tips and arranged transportation to the airport. Breakfast is included and located in the main lobby which was designed to feel like a living room. So thoughtful and cute. The lobby is my favorite part of the hotel. The decor is warm and welcoming and makes you feel right at home. I highly recommend 18 Micon St and plan to return soon!

We were in Greece for two weeks and unfortunately only stayed here our last night, but we would have loved to have made it our home base! The hotel was thoughtfully done ( after comparing to other hotels we stayed in which were also nice) , but this had amenities that were well thought out. Great layouts of rooms, great breakfast, amazing decor, and showers and lockers for luggage available for late check out! The staff was friendly and accommodating. We stayed at other boutique hotels in town that were fine, but found that the rooms here were much bigger and the bathroom layout much better and priced the same! If I were to go to Athens again or know someone who was, this is definitely where I would stay! Athens is a great city, to someone going there for the first time , don’t be put off by the amount of graffiti ... to Americans it may associated with seedier neighborhoods but in Athens, it is just part of the city and the more you walk around , you actually consider it somewhat charming! 18 Micon Street is in such an area of graffiti but it’s awesome!","April 6, 2019","30    18 Micon Str.

I stayed in two different rooms and they both were very nicely decorated, the beds and pillows really comfortable, nice good quality toiletries, towels, etc. The room at the top floor has the added bonus of a balcony (not very useful in December though) and proper total-blackout blinds (should be compulsory in every establishment in my opinion).The staff is extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them: they really are an amazing group of people and most of them speak flawless English too.The breakfast was really good, all fresh products: not much in terms of hot items, but a good choice of savoury and sweet (the apple and cinnamon cake was delicious). Great choice of cereals, nuts, dry and fresh fruit. They also had complimentary tea and coffee during the day as well as very nice biscuits fresh from the bakery.The location is great too, although it looks quite rundown during the day, it really comes alive at night with plenty of good restaurants and bars all nicely lit up. It's also walking distance to all the main sights in Athens: we only needed to use the metro once to go to the Archeological Museum.The only things I didn't like are the sinks, which are located outside the bathrooms and the noise at night, but the hotel provides foam earplug (they don't work for me, but I always carry my own silicon ones).","December 11, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

Convenient location...few minutes of easy walk to the ancient Agora and other Athens' attractions.Just know that:1) The hotel itself does not have graffiti on its property. However, its neighbors are full of graffitis making me a little concerned about safety when we first checked in. However, I noticed graffitis seem to be all over most of Athens, so maybe the hotel's location is not really too bad. 2) We are next to a bar which was noisy even after past 2am. On our second night, I realized I should have closed the windows--this lessened the noise.3) Although the room was decorated very nicely, the room is bare bones.

1685,"This hotel is an excellent choice for your stay in Athens. The location is near Monastiraki and close to public transportation and walking distance to the tourist attractions, restaurants, and shops. This hotel was also one of the cleanest I have ever seen, my feet were not dirty after walking barefoot on the floor. The staff is super friendly and willing to help out any way that they can. If you tell the staff ahead of time that you need to leave the hotel before breakfast starts, they will give you a bagged breakfast of fruit, bread, and water to make sure you are energized for the day ahead. I would definitely stay in this hotel again. ","August 14, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

1686,"We knew we had made the right decision about our accommodation in Athens the minute we walked through the door. A great location close to all the sites. We had plenty of recommendations from the very helpful staff - Restaurants, shopping, sightseeing etc. The room was very comfortable. Gorgeous decor and linens. By far the most convenient aspect was the ‘handy’ device which we could take with us around the city to help navigate and research what we wanted to do. Also I must mention that the breakfast was stunning. You really felt like you were dining in someone’s home. A great mid-priced option for Athens. ","August 11, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

1689,"My wife and I recently stayed two nights in this hotel and were quite happy with our overall stay. Location is great, right in the middle of the restaurant district, service was also very good and the room was very clean and add a nice balcony with two lounge chairs and a small bistro set. Only reason why we are not giving this hotel five stars is for two reasons: one is the fact that the room was quite small and the other is that the pillows were simply not comfortable. In hindsight I should have asked for a new pillow for our 2nd night. You should also know that we could hear music from our room coming from down on the street till about 1AM both nights. Not a deal breaker, it wasn’t very loud club music but rather traditional Greek music, but still good to know. We liked this hotel very much.","July 26, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

1690,"I stayed here on July 17-19 2018. My overall experience was very good and I would consider returning for another stay. I am a Greek-American with a home in Western Greece. I spend one or two nights in Athens every summer before flying back to the States and I have stayed at many different Athens hotels over the years. I am fairly familiar with the area and I speak Greek, which influences, to some degree, my thoughts about this property. However, my review is based upon my own experiences at 18 Micon as well as my observations of staff interactions with tourists. 1. Great location. I love the Monasteraki area and this property borders it. You can reach Monasteraki by foot in a matter of minutes. If you have a car, there is a small parking lot on Miconos about 30 meters from the hotel (10 euros per night parking fee).There is also a small restaurant on Miconos St. just before the parking with excellent and reasonably priced Greek food (it is not a tourist restaurant and only locals were there when we visited). The restaurant is literally a minute away by foot!2. The hotel property is a former warehouse which was converted to a hotel in 2017. The rooms have a modern industrial feel. They are simple, yet well-appointed, and immaculately clean. However, I did not like that the double sinks in my room were located outside the bathroom (which was huge with an immense shower stall). Also, there was no closet to hang clothes and store shoes, suitcases etc.3. My room was on the second floor (Room #8) and it faced Miconos Street. It was a bit noisy later at night from two restaurants around the corner on Aesop. The hotel's interior walls are not well insulated and if noise is a factor you may hear the restaurant patrons below and other guests returning late at night to their rooms. The noise was not bad, though, and it did not prevent me from sleeping comfortably. If you don't want to hear noise from Athenian nightlife, stay outside the bustling city nieghborhoods! 4. The breakfast was very good and it is served in the large and comfortable reception area on the first floor. There was an excellent selection of spanakopita (tasted home-made), meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, yogurt with a choice of toppings, hard-boiled eggs, coffee and juices, etc. Coffee, cold water and cookies/candies are available in this area all day and this is a nice place to relax, read or wait for friends.5. The staff is extraordinary and each demonstrated the hospitality for which the Greeks are famous! I cannot say enough about their friendliness, graciousness and desire to help in every way possible. Friends came to meet me for day out and upon their arrival, we were treated like guests in a private home.......a warm welcome, complimentary liqueurs, wine and cookies (it was my birthday) and a feel like I was entertaining in my own home. 6. Others here have positively reported on the smart phone provided with each room that you can use for free international calls and tourist information. We had trouble using it (it may just have been us and not the phone). It did not present a problem because we have Greek cell phones and tried it as a novelty).7. As for pricing/room cost there are less costly rooms available in equally good locations. But, the rooms will not be as ""new"" and the breakfast, parking etc not so great. Moreover, I doubt you will find a staff like folks at 18 Micon Street.","July 20, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

The fruit salad was especially awesome. Huge American-sized king bed. Excellent air conditioning. My only suggestion is that the local information provided needs improvement. For a small and intimate hotel, it should be easier to get local info and recommendations. When we arrived off an international overnight flight, we didn’t get a clear recommendation of where to get an early lunch. Also, I emailed in advance for information about visiting the Parthenon and I received information about visiting the Acropolis Museum, which turns out is a separate ticket from the Parthenon. The hotel should have prepared tips about visiting the Parthenon. ","June 17, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

1697,"It is a shame to rate this hotel as a three but there are some unavoidable downsides.The upsides are the service which is so good, there team are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The Hotel decor is excellent, from the trendy lobby to the fantastically comfortable beds, the interiors are considered and highly designed; very cool. Each room has a handheld device that you can take with you that helps you with anything you need in Athens and enables you to make free calls. It's a nice idea but not really needed for anyone with a smartphone.The rooms are spacious and have a nicely stocked minibar though ours wasn't cold, I'm sure this was an exception. The coffee machine was Nespresso and complimentary water was included. location is central Athens and within walking distance of metro and buses, a positive in many respects but ...Now the negatives. The locations whilst being central is a little back street for my liking and my partner said she wouldn't recommend it to a single woman travelling alone. It is also next door to what could be described as a slum (picture from balcony attached).The hotels has noise coming from the street but it's a city hotel and you'll get this anywhere. However the noise from inside the hotel is what sets it apart, the floors are not well insulated and you can hear people going to the toilet above you, the wall seem very thin and the water system seems to scream at you everytime someone in a nearby room turns on a tap.The breakfast is basic with no hot breakfast to speak of, it's served in a communal kitchen/ lobby area which is very nice and as a cold breakfast it is acceptable. Freshly squeezed (Yourself) orange juice is a nice touch and the coffee is fantastic.There is no bar though there is a restaurant next door that will bring drinks to your room or the lobby.There is storage for bags when you are not in the hotel and lockers for valuable which is a good touch.There is a lift though there are some steps so not perfectly accessible for those in a wheelchair.On the whole I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend this hotel, though this is no reflection on its team and indeed the concept and design. Location, building and communal features is what means this is just not quite what it could have been.","May 21, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

1698,"We arrived here and were pleasantly greeted by the staff at the reception area. Promptly given our keys to the room and notified us that there wouldn’t be any staff on site after 11pm until the morning. This was not a huge concern. However, we noticed that when we were trying to close the window there were some issues getting it to sit right to lock and close. We did our best to close it. Unfortunately, we didn’t realize that the window was defective, so we heard A LOT of outside noise for several hours (at least until 2am). This was surprising for a Sunday night, there was loud music playing from the restaurant adjacent to the hotel and later what I could assume were stray dogs barking at everything that passed by. It made it quite difficult to sleep after a long flight. However, I digress- the room was otherwise clean and we were able to adjust the temperature that suited our needs. The downside however, the sink is outside the bathroom and there is no true counter space on the existing sink. This leaves no place for you to leave toiletries or clothes when it’s time to shower. On one of the mornings while showering, the protective cover of one of the vents fell off and onto the floor. Luckily no one was on the toilet, otherwise that could’ve been a problem. We notified the staff about this and it was promptly fixed. The breakfast buffet has a few options, but if you’re not interested in the things they have you can certainly go elsewhere. While we only stayed at Micon 18 for two nights, they were both equally restless as the noise did not subside throughout the middle of the night. It was quite surprising as the street tends to be on the quieter side during the day. Despite the window being repaired, the rooms are not properly soundproof as you can hear noise both in the hallways (elevator and room doors) and outdoors. The staff was very accommodating and nice throughout our stay and were fluent in English, which made communication very easy. While the hotel is centrally located to everything, the downside is that the crowds gravitate to this area as well. ","April 26, 2018","30    18 Micon Str.

1701,"Spent 3 nights at 18 Micon Str. hotel. A fantastic boutique hotel that has been open for one year. The rooms are nicely furnished and in great condition. The lobby is spacious with comfortable chairs and couches looking out on to the picturesque street. Each morning there was a very nice buffet breakfast consisting of juice, cheese, meats, yogurt, nuts, cereals, breads, fruit, coffee, etc. All fresh and delicious! The self serve kitchen in the lobby is open and available to guests all day should you wish to have a cup of coffee or tea.The hotel is centrally located. All the major sights are just a few minutes walking distance. Multiple nice restaurants are just right out the front door!As noted above, the hotel is new, so it was no surprise that the room was modern, well decorated and spotless. Nice large bathroom. Our room (although not all) had a nice outside balcony with chairs and a table. Plenty of outlets but none dedicated for USB so bring an adapter. WiFi was very strong in the rooms and throughout the hotel.Lockers are available which was great as we took an overnight trip to Delphi and need to store some of our luggage before we returned. The staff is superb. Can not say enough nice things about them. They treated us as family throughout our entire stay and made us feel at home the moment we walked in. Last week was the hotels first anniversary. Management threw a nice little party and included all the guests in the festivities. We were unaware of the party (our fault) but they even waited for us to come back from our overnight trip before they began! Small thoughtful gifts were given to everyone, even our two kids.Each room also comes with a cell phone ""type"" of device. I didn't figure out all the functions (I THINK you can put your own cell phone number in and make calls/texts - we didn't use this function) but it was extremely helpful as it had Google Maps/GPS to help you navigate the maze of small streets in Athens looking for sites and restaurants.

Only a short walk to the busy Syntagma square.staff were lovely, we even received a bottle of wine as a gift on valentines day, which was a very sweet surprise! breakfast was the usual sort of thing; cereal, bread, fruit, greek yogurt, cold meat/cheese, boiled eggs etc. it was fine though, always plenty there and never felt rushed to finish even when it came to the end of the breakfast time. Our room was a good size, but it was facing the street, which got pretty loud at night since the local places stayed open late, but it didn't bother us, it was mostly music so we didn't mind. I found the pillows impossible to sleep on, simply as they were so big/high. I'm used to soft thin ones so I just couldn't get comfortable, my partner had no problem with them though so it's just one of those things. the free bottle of water each day was useful and the in-room coffee machine was nice.I have to say though the coffee machine used during breakfast isn't very professional. It's a small one meant for use in your home, it can only do a couple cups before it needs to be refilled and reheat, it really needs an upgrade to avoid people queuing every morning.

Firstly, this is a small boutique hotel so you won't find a 50 metre pool or pancake station at breakfast but what we received was wonderful boutique hotel service. The ladies on the front desk were incredibly helpful and very good with the kid's. They gave us really useful travel advice and even provided a packed breakfast as we left early for a day trip. This is the type of service that will ensure we come back. We stayed in a two bedroom family room with a balcony which was ideal for us. The hotel is very well designed with lovely modern interior decoration. The hotel is also set in the heart of everything and so we could easily walk everywhere.

1717,"We stayed for 3 nights. Just got home. It's a very simple, perfectly formed hotel. Not fussy, but excellent style and design. We had a very nice welcome, then took ourselves to our room (602). From the balcony to the right you could see the Acropolis/Parthenon, to the left you could (in the distance) see the sea. Room was very clean (just been cleaned, and even the inside of the drawers were damp from being wiped). A very nice room, with just enough space (but you had to sort of side-ways shuffle at the end of the bed for fear of knocking the TV off the wall). There were 3 of us in the room and the layout was fine. Enough storage/lights/sockets. There was a fridge (with nothing in it). There were also no details of anything in the room (no folder for room service, trips, etc). Breakfast (on the 1st floor) was absolutely fine. Certainly enough. If you are after a full English or table service, then this is not the place for you, but the pastries, yogurt, toast, cereals, cheese/salami etc were more than enough (there is a small area for hot food - scrambled eggs, mini sausages, bacon, beans) - a good selection. Food seemed to be replenished quickly when it ran low and you could eat as much as you wanted. We were out most of each day, but our room was cleaned perfectly every day. All the people working there seemed very friendly and helpful. As our room was facing the road, there was a little traffic noise, and we were opposite the lift, so a little corridor noise, but nothing too annoying - and we had fab views. Great air-con! Really can't fault anything. Now, if I was to make anything better... I would add a kettle and tea/coffee making facilities to the room, fill the fridge in the room with drinks (hotel makes more money) and have a folder in the room explaining how to order drinks (if you can) from your room or the 5th floor roof terrace and advice about trips and sight seeing and when the hotel pool is open. But that's it. It's a great little hotel, in a quiet location, but walkable to everything you'll want to see. Almost perfect. Highly recommend. Thank you for having us.","April 12, 2019","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

1720,"Just got home from Athens and had to post my thoughts on our stay. Arrived quite late after a delayed flight and were checked in quickly and given an orientation of the hotel layout by the receptionist. Arrived in our room and found that it looked exactly as expected, sleek, modern and clean and even had an extra bed! Bathroom was modern and clean and the shower was huge, we even had an unexpected balcony. The beds were extremely comfortable. Breakfast was very good, huge selection and attentive staff to refill anything. Breakfast room was downstairs and next to the pool and had lots of tables. I only ever saw it about a third full. Roof terrace is not to be missed as the view over the city is stunning. Room was missing a kettle but did have a fridge. Location was extremely quiet and our room overlooked a courtyard (of sorts) and the back of a residential building. Felt very safe walking around the nearby streets. Location was good, it is away from the main hotel district and the old town and attractions, but it is a 10 minute walk to everywhere you’ll want to be. Overall, highly recommended, the staff were lovely and nothing was ever too much trouble for them. I’d definitely come back if I was in the city again.","February 13, 2019","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

Staff are very friendly and helpful always greet you with a smile, we quizzed them several times with directions places to see etc. Breakfast has a very good selection, more than enough to fuel you for a full days excursions. Only criticism I would say here is at times the eggs and bacon in the ban marie were cold. This could be remedied by asking staff to microwave for you! Location is excellent. Close enough to take in local restaurants and bars. But away from noisy hustle and bustle. You can also easily walk to many of the main attractions from this hotel.

It's close to everything - and only a 10 min walk to Acropolis - but still not in a touristy area. It's very safe and charming, and there are lots of places to eat nearby.My room felt fresh and new, the balcony was amazing, cleaning was perfect, and breakfast was great too. The cleaning women and the woman, Voula, at the reception were really sweet. Only thing is that the name of the hotel doesn't lie. It really is situated at the top of a hill. So it's a bit of a climb (though a short one!) getting there. But again - the position at the hill is what gives you the great view!

1727,"The Acroplis Hill Hotel is located in a quiet residential area yet is only a ten minute walk from the Acropolis and Plaka areas. That said, as the name suggests, it is at the top of a hill, so it is a trek ! Rooms are compact but cleaned to a high standard. Safe (at no extra cost), refridgerator, hairdryer, air conditioning and wall mounted LCD TV are all included. The compact bathroom is a wet room so a little unusable once you've had a shower but not a big issue. All rooms feature a balcony. Ours looked directly down into the hotel pool (which was still open when we visited in October, with towels available from reception).Breakfast is served on the lower floor overlooking the pool. Help yourself to a good range of cereal, pastries, fruit, and hot drinks. Bacon and scrambled eggs were also available.There is a bar on the reception level, but you can take your drink to the rooftop seating area for a good view of the Acropolis and cityscape.All in all, I was happy with my choice of this hotel and am happy to recommend as a comfortable and convenient base from which to visit the main sights of Athens.","October 22, 2018","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

1728,"We stayed here for four days. This hotel is located near the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum; the Acropolis parking lot is also where the on/off bus stops which made this very convenient since we paid for two-day passes. We were also near the Dionysos Zonars restaurant and Strofi's restaurant (which is recommended by many travel guides); both restaurants had wonderful views of the Acropolis. This hotel is far from the commercial downtown Athens area so perhaps not everyone would like the location. The room was small but clean and had a balcony. There is a fantastic view of the Acropolis from the rooftop garden. Excellent breakfasts. My only complaint was the short walk from the hotel to the Acropolis area. While only 10 minutes, the walk was difficult. The sidewalks vary from 4 ft to 1 ft; sometimes the sidewalk disappeared; taxis and cars park on the sidewalk too so often we were walking in the two-lane street constantly listening for oncoming cars.

The feta cheese was delicious;) The hotel has an outdoor pool, but we did not use it - it was too cold.Metro station near the hotel, 5 minutes walk, but to get to the hotel you have to climb a bit;) Great location - Acropolis hill was 5 minutes walk, flea market was a 2 minute walk, restaurants, grocery stores, everything within 5-10 minutes walk.I would highly recommend.","September 25, 2018","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

The reception/lounge area and pool area are not very inviting so don’t book this hotel if you want accommodation with a nice ambience. There are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room so when I wanted a cup of tea, I had to order it in the reception area and drink it there (where there was no one else) once brought to me by a waiter. The location of the hotel is fantastic, walking distance to many sites and other tourist attractions. It’s is in a residential area so much quieter and pleasant than in the middle of the CBD.

1750,"The Acropolis Hill Hotel Athens next to Syngrou-Fix station on the Metro's red line is an exceptionally good in the form of comfort, style and stay.The hotel is located on Mouson Street up the hill from Syngrou Fix station. Once you arrive at station (Metro card €9 for 5 days plus €10 for the airport transfer via Syntagma Square) you'll walk up Drakou towards and turn right up the steps of Mark. Mpotsari and turn right onto Mouson Street (take a breath) and you'll be greeted by the front automated doors of the hotel reception areaThe reception staff were professional, always with a smile and always there to help and support with queries and questions - for that, I cannot thank them enough. I stayed in room 601 on the top floor and a lovely view of the Parthenon on the Acropolis - wow what a view! On the 6th and 5th floor are patios with ample space to bathe in the sun and admire the Acropolis Hill in comfort.You are a mere 5 to 10 minute walk to the Parthenon from the hotel. Once you're out of the main entrance of the hotel, turn right and walk along the road and around the left turn towards the Acropolis Hill. You'll be greeted with the parking lot where buses and coaches drop touristsoff for the Parthenon. Here, you can navigate to the north and south gates of the Acropolis. I would advise that you get to the ticket booth of the Parthenon around 7.45am during the off season November to March at €10 reduced entry price. I had 45 minutes on the Acropolis plateau where the Parthenon sits. The Vista is epic!Back to the room and stay at the hotel. The room was suitably large with storage and safe with a refrigerator. The AC works very well! The balcony is a good size and an amazing view of the Parthenon and at night, just see!The bathroom is small but we'll equipped. A walk-in shower is good. The bed was adequate, but can be better. The bedside cabinets are well placed with sockets and lights for your devices.I had breakfast included with my stay. The continental set up is great! The associates setting up the food and beverages are excellent. The food was of good quality and plentiful. You're faced with a view of the hotels swimming pool. The lay out is spacious, but gets busy between 8am and.9am. I had breakfast at 7am. I believe breakfast is served from 6am, but do check with reception.I will definitely stay here again as access to sites are within walking distance. You can walk to Thissio within 20 minutes and Syntagma Square within 20 to 30 minutes. There are buses and.trams nearby, but I didn't try these modes of transport.Do stay here.","March 4, 2018","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

1751,Our room has the view of Acropolis and the bed is sooo comfortable! We slept good during our 2 night stay and although our room is facing the main road it wasn’t loud and didn’t hear any noise. Very close to everything and the view of Acropolis at night is amazing! The ladies at the front desk are very friendly and spoke good English! Will definitely recommend this place!,"February 24, 2018","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

The rooftop terrace amazing. The breakfast also amazing!! Swimming pool, not in February, it would be nice in the height of summer to cool off though. Great location too :) ","February 14, 2018","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

1755,"This is a super hotel in an excellent location and fantastic value too. Our bedroom 408 was so quiet you could sleep with the door to the balcony wide open and there was no noise at night. Small bedroom and bathroom but very clean and very comfy bed. Efficient free wifi. Breakfast included in the rate and is really good. The pool looked very clean and is about 12 meters long I guess, had it been a bit warmer (it's unheated) I would have used it! Lovely staff. Altogether a great option, I would recommend it highly.","December 4, 2017","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

1756,"A small hotel but very clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly, and the breakfast is good. The hotel is literally 5 min walk from Acropolis and is located on a quite road. The best thing about this hotel was that our balcony had a view of acropolis, and a roof terrace. The roof terrace has an amazing view of the Acropolis and the city. It was a perfect place to chill with a glass of wine after a day out. I would be happy to stay there again.","November 11, 2017","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

1757,"This was a great clean place to escape the Athens sun. The location was great if you are in shape to walk up the hill. It is next to a park with great views of the Parthenon which can also be seen from the roof. Down the hill, it is an easy walk to the subway (to the airport). There is also a great breakfast here (the photo I took was just one plate and does not do it justice).","November 4, 2017","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

Also outside patio with tables overlooking the city and Acropolis. Careful with room choice as lower one seemed to smell.

The breakfast is plentiful and in our experience the room was pretty quiet.

Its a bit of a walk to the city's attractions and transport but if you like an unassuming hotel with great service and facilities this hotel fits the bill. Great little bars and restaurants about 15 mins walk away, another 10 mins and you're at the new Acropolis Museum, Hardrians Arch and Temple of Zeus. ","October 11, 2017","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel

1762,"We had a really enjoyable stay in the Acropolis Hill Hotel. It started with a really warm welcome from Haris on the evening we arrived. He helped us to get a room on the front of the hotel with a balcony that had a fantastic view of the Acropolis Hill and the Pantheon in one direction and the sea in the other direction. We could not have asked more from the wonderful team in the hotel, great service and they made us feel really valued when ever me made a request. Our room was clean, luxurious and the bed was really comfortable. The roof terrace has an amazing view of Athens. The breakfast was delicious and there was an excellent range of items to give us a great start to some long and memorable days in Athens. We loved our stay in Greece, Athens and the Acropolis Hill Hotel, the Greek people were lovely and we can't wait to return to this hotel. Thank you!","September 22, 2017","31    Acropolis Hill Hotel
